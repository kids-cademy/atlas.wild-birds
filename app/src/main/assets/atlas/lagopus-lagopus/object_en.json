{"index":58,"rank":0,"name":"lagopus-lagopus","display":"Willow ptarmigan","definition":"The willow ptarmigan is a bird in the grouse subfamily Tetraoninae of the pheasant family Phasianidae.","description":"<p>The willow ptarmigan is a medium to large ground-dwelling bird and is the most numerous of the three species of ptarmigan.</p><p>Males and females are about the same size, the adult length varying between 35 and 44 centimeters with a wingspan ranging from 60 and 65 centimeters. </p><p>It is deep-chested and has a fairly long neck, a broad bill, short feathered legs and a moderately short rounded tail.</p><p>In the summer, the male's plumage is marbled brown, with a reddish hue to the neck and breast, a black tail and white wings and underparts. </p><p>It has two inconspicuous wattles above the eyes, which become red and prominent in the breeding season. </p><p>The female is similar in appearance but lacks the wattles and has brown feathers scattered among the white feathers on the belly. </p><p>During winter, the plumage of both sexes becomes completely white, except for some black feathers in the tail. </p><p>Immature birds resemble the adults.</p><p>The willow ptarmigan has a circum-boreal distribution. </p><p>It primarily occupies subalpine and subarctic habitats such as sparse pine and birch forests, thickets with willow and alder trees, heather moors, tundra and mountain slopes.</p><p>In the winter, females and sub-adults may move to lower altitudes and seek shelter in valleys or in more densely vegetated areas.</p><p>The willow ptarmigan has a varied and seasonal diet.</p><p>The bird is herbivorous for most of its life and subsists on various plant materials.</p><p>As juveniles, they may feed on insects and young plant growth due to an inability to digest plant material caused by underdeveloped cecums. </p><p>In the summer, their diet is highly varied and may consist of berries, flowers, leaves, twigs, buds and seeds.</p><p>During the winter this birds largely subsist on the buds and twigs of willow and other dwarf shrubs and trees.</p><p>Male willow ptarmigans are territorial birds. Males arrive in the breeding areas and set up territories in April and May, aggressively defending them against male interlopers. </p><p>A small minority of male willow ptarmigan are polygynous but most are monogamous. </p><p>Nesting takes place in the spring when clutches of four to ten eggs are laid in a scrape on the ground.</p><p>The chicks are precocial and soon leave the nest.</p><p>While they are young, both parents play a part in caring for them.</p><p>In particular, the male defends the young from predators and both he and his mate can dive-bomb intruders or lure attackers away by pretending to have a broken wing. </p><p>Nevertheless, the chicks face many dangers which range from attacks by foxes or birds of prey. </p><p>Fewer than a third of chicks survive to eleven months and only a minority of these reach maturity. </p><p>The willow ptarmigan was adopted as the state bird of Alaska in 1955.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/lagopus-lagopus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/lagopus-lagopus/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/lagopus-lagopus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/lagopus-lagopus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/lagopus-lagopus/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/lagopus-lagopus/featured.png","caption":"<p>In the summer the birds are largely brown, with dappled plumage, but in the winter they are white, sometimes with few black feathers in their tails.</p>\n<p>Feet are also covered with feather.
