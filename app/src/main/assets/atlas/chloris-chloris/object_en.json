{"index":35,"rank":0,"name":"chloris-chloris","display":"European greenfinch","definition":"A widespread Eurasian finch having green and yellow plumage.","description":"<p>The European greenfinch is a small passerine bird in the finch family.</p><p>It is similar in size and shape to a house sparrow, but is mainly green, with yellow in the wings and tail. </p><p>This bird is widespread throughout Europe, north Africa and south west Asia.</p><p>It is mainly resident, but some northernmost populations migrate further south.</p><p>European greenfinch is a stocky bird with plump body. Adult male in breeding plumage is olive-green washed yellow on the upperparts. </p><p>Upperwings are darker. Flight feathers are rather grey with bright yellow edges on primaries. </p><p>When the wings are closed, we can see a conspicuous yellow patch. </p><p>Adult female is duller, browner overall. The yellow wing patches are less conspicuous. </p><p>Her plumage is slightly washed green or yellow in the centre of belly.</p><p>Juvenile resembles female but with greyer plumage, heavily streaked darker overall. </p><p>European greenfinch feeds mainly on sunflower seeds, but it also takes seeds from varied other plants, buds, berries and insects during the nesting period.</p><p>The diet is fairly varied and although the primary food is seeds, in the breeding season insects, including beetles, are eaten and fed to the young birds. </p><p>This species often frequents the bird-feeders in winter, and is particularly fond of sunflower seeds. </p><p>This species can form large flocks outside the breeding season, sometimes mixing with other finches and buntings. </p><p>Breeding season occurs in spring, starting in the second half of March, until June, with fledging young in early July. </p><p>Woodland edges, farmland hedges and gardens with relatively thick vegetation are favoured for breeding.</p><p>Greenfinch nests in trees or bushes, laying 3 to 6 eggs. </p><p>Incubation lasts about 13 to 14 days, by the female. Male feeds her at the nest during this period. </p><p>Chicks are fed on insect larvae by both adults during the first days, and later, by frequent regurgitated yellowish paste of seeds. </p><p>They leave the nest about 13 days later but they are not able to fly. Usually, they fledge 16 to 18 days after hatching. </p><p>This species produces two or three broods per year.</p><p>Greenfinch song contains a lot of trilling twitters interspersed with wheezes, and the male has a \"butterfly\" display flight. </p><p>Besides its native area, the greenfinch has also been introduced into Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay, and Argentina.</p><p>In Malta, it is considered a prestigious song bird, and it has been trapped for many years.</p><p>It has been domesticated, and many Maltese people breed them.</p><p>In Hungary, it is threatened.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/chloris-chloris/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/chloris-chloris/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/chloris-chloris/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/chloris-chloris/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/chloris-chloris/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/chloris-chloris/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-25T02:56:00Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Passeriformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Fringillidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Chloris"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Chloris chloris"}],"aliases":["Greenfinch"],"spreading":[{"name":"Africa","area":"NORTH","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Asia","area":"WEST","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Europe","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"European greenfinch song","samplePath":"atlas/chloris-chloris/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/chloris-chloris/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/chloris-chloris/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"length","value":0.14,"maximum":0.15,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"14 to 15 cm"},{"name":"wingspan","value":0.245,"maximum":0.275,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"24.5 to 27.5 cm"},{"name":"weight","value":0.025,"maximum":0.035,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"25 to 35 grams"},{"name":"lifespan","value":0.0,"maximum":4.10240376E8,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"Up to 13 years"}],"related":[{"index":0,"display":"American goldfinch","definition":"The American goldfinch is a small North American bird in the finch family.","iconPath":"atlas/spinus-tristis/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":34,"display":"European goldfinch","definition":"The European goldfinch is a small passerine bird in the finch family that is native to Europe, North Africa and western Asia.","iconPath":"atlas/carduelis-carduelis/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null}],"links":[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_greenfinch","display":"Wikipedia","description":"Wikipedia article about european greenfinch.","iconPath":"link/wikipedia.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/wikipedia.png"},{"url":"https://ebird.org/species/eurgre1/","display":"eBird","description":"eBird observations about european greenfinch.","iconPath":"link/ebird.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/ebird.png"},{"url":"https://www.britannica.com/animal/greenfinch#ref133268","display":"Encyclop√¶dia Britannica","description":"European greenfinch article on Britannica.","iconPath":"link/britannica.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/britannica.png"},{"url":"https://kids.kiddle.co/Greenfinch","display":"Kiddle","description":"European greenfinch facts for kids.","iconPath":"link/kiddle.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/kiddle.png"},{"url":"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22720330/132000123","display":"IUCN Red List","description":"IUCN Red List index of european greenfinch.","iconPath":"link/iucnredlist.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/iucnredlist.png"},{"url":"https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=997806#null","display":"Taxonomic Information System","description":"ITIS taxonomy for european greenfinch.","iconPath":"link/itis.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/itis.png"},{"url":"https://eol.org/pages/45513400","display":"Encyclopedia of Life","description":"Data, maps and articles about european greenfinch.","iconPath":"link/eol.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/eol.png"},{"url":"https://www.thefreedictionary.com/European+greenfinch","display":"The Free Dictionary","description":"European greenfinch definition on dictionary.","iconPath":"link/thefreedictionary.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/thefreedictionary.png"}]}
