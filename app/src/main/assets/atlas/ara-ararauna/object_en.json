{"index":10,"rank":0,"name":"ara-ararauna","display":"Blue-and-yellow macaw","definition":"The blue-and-yellow macaw is a large South American parrot with mostly blue top parts and light orange underparts, with gradient hues of green on top of its head.","description":"<p>Blue-and-yellow macaw is a member of the large group of neotropical parrots known as macaws.</p><p>It inhabits forest, woodland and savannah of tropical South America.</p><p>This macaw is vivid in appearance with light blue feathers on the top of its wings, and torso, and darker on the tail.</p><p>The frontmost half of the top of its head is covered with lime feathers. </p><p>On the bottom of these aforementioned areas of its body are light orange feathers. </p><p>Its beak is black, as well as the feathers under their chin. Its feet, save for the talons, are of a gray color. </p><p>The blue-and-yellow macaw uses its powerful beak for breaking nutshells, and for climbing up and hanging from trees.</p><p>These birds can reach a length of 76 to 86 centimeters and weigh 900 grams to 1.5 kilograms, making them some of the larger members of their family. </p><p>Blue-and-yellow macaw, as other macaws, eats clay and minerals on riverbanks. </p><p>It feeds on several plant species, including toxic plants. To eat clay allows him to digest the poisonous contained into fruits and seeds of these plants.</p><p>But usually, Blue-and-yellow macaw feeds on fruits or some parts of them, nuts, berries, blooms, leaves, and flowers of Combretum. Its favourite seeds come from Hura crepitans trees.</p><p>Blue-and-yellow macaw reaches sexual maturity at 3 to 4 years of age. </p><p>Breeding season is during the first half of the year and they breed about every 1 to 2 years. </p><p>Nests are found high up in tall trees, mainly in cavities already made by other animals. </p><p>Females lay 2 to 3 eggs and incubate them for 24 to 28 days, after which the young hatch blind and featherless. </p><p>After 10 days the young begin to develop feathers. Within 3 months fledglings become independent.</p><p>Blue-and-yellow macaws communicate by loud vocalizations or flock calls. </p><p>They also have highly developed visual acuity. They have very complex social behavior and vocalizations, as do all macaws.</p><p>Blue-and-yellow macaw's predators are birds of prey such as harpy eagle, hawk eagle and orange-breasted falcon. They can attack macaws when in flight.</p><p>They are popular in aviculture because of their striking color, ability to talk, ready availability in the marketplace, and close bonding to humans.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/ara-ararauna/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ara-ararauna/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/ara-ararauna/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ara-ararauna/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/ara-ararauna/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ara-ararauna/featured.png","caption":"<p>Blue-and-yellow macaws will often fly in pairs, but can also be found in larger family groups and even bigger flocks, as they fly to and from feeding grounds.</p>"},"icon":{"path":"atlas/ara-ararauna/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ara-ararauna/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T02:24:01Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Psittaciformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Psittacidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Ara"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Ara ararauna"}],"aliases":["Blue-and-gold macaw"],"spreading":[{"name":"Tropical South America","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Blue-and-yellow macaw call.","samplePath":"atlas/ara-ararauna/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/ara-ararauna/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ara-ararauna/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"lifespan","value":9.4670856E8,"maximum":1.10449332E9,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"30 to 35 years"},{"name":"lifespan.captivity","value":0.0,"maximum":1.356948936E9,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan in Captivity","valueDisplay":"Up to 43 years"},{"name":"length","value":0.76,"maximum":0.86,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"76 to 86 cm"},{"name":"wingspan","value":1.05,"maximum":1.15,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"1.05 to 1.15 m"},{"name":"weight","value":0.9,"maximum":1.5,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"900 grams to 1.5 kg"},{"name":"speed","value":0.0,"maximum":15.5556,"quantity":"SPEED","nameDisplay":"Speed","valueDisplay":"Up to 56 km/h"},{"name":"elevation","value":0.0,"maximum":500.0,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Elevation","valueDisplay":"Up to 500 m"}],"related":[{"index":11,"display":"Budgerigar","definition":"The budgerigar is a long-tailed, seed-eating parrot usually nicknamed the budgie, or in American English, the parakeet.","iconPath":"atlas/melopsittacus-undulatus/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":49,"display":"Red-tailed black cockatoo","definition":"The red-tailed black cockatoo is a large black cockatoo native to Australia.
