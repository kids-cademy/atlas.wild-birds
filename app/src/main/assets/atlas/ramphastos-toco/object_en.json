{"index":53,"rank":0,"name":"ramphastos-toco","display":"Toco toucan","definition":"The toco toucan is the largest and probably the best known species in the toucan family.","description":"<p>The toco toucan, the largest and best-known toucan species, is at home in South America's tropical forests. </p><p>Its oversized, colorful bill has made it one of the world's most popular birds.</p><p>Its exact purpose isn't clear, though it is believed to play a role in the courthship ritual and in self-defense. </p><p>As a weapon, however, the bill is more show than substance since  it is in fact a lightweight honeycomb of keratin, supported by thin rods of bone.</p><p>Anyway, the bill is useful as a feeding tool. The birds use them to reach fruit on branches that are too small to support their weight. </p><p>The toco toucan feasts on berries, seeds and fruits — especially figs, oranges, and guavas, that cluster in treetops. </p><p>The toucan supplements its vegetarian diet by seizing spiders and insects, frogs, small reptiles and small birds.</p><p>It often steals the eggs and young of other birds as well.</p><p>Toco toucan can weight nearly 600 grams and grow to 65 centimeters long, with their bill accounting for nearly one third of their length.</p><p>The toco toucan roosts on a large branch at night, twisting its head so that its bill nestles in the warm feathers on its back. </p><p>At first light, the bird rouses and begins searching for food. </p><p>The toucan stays among the topmost foliage, and moves by hopping from branch to branch rather than by flapping.</p><p>Small groups of toco toucans often indulge in playful antics: the birds jump around each other and stage mock push-and-shove contests with their bills. </p><p>Toucans remove dust and sticky seeds by gently nibbling one another’s feathers with the tips of their mandibles.</p><p>These toucans nest in tree cavities and usually lay two to four eggs, which both parents take turns incubating. </p><p>Young toucans do not have a large bill at birth—it grows as they develop and does not become full size for several months.</p><p>It is a common attraction in zoos.</p><p>Indigenous peoples regard the bird with a sacred eye; they are traditionally seen as conduits between the worlds of the living and the spirits.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/ramphastos-toco/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ramphastos-toco/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/ramphastos-toco/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ramphastos-toco/cover.png","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/ramphastos-toco/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ramphastos-toco/featured.png","caption":"<p>Fruits develop on slender twigs, too fragile for the bird’s weight, but the toucan can use its long bill to reach out from a sturdy branch. </p><p>Although clumsy looking, the bill is dexterous enough to handle small morsels of food with finesse.</p>"},"icon":{"path":"atlas/ramphastos-toco/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ramphastos-toco/icon.jpg","caption":null},"trivia":{"path":"atlas/ramphastos-toco/trivia.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ramphastos-toco/trivia.png","caption":"<p>In flight, toco toucan alternates between a burst of rapid flaps with the relatively short, rounded wings, and gliding.</p>"}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T13:49:19Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Piciformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Ramphastidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Ramphastos"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Ramphastos toco"}],"aliases":["Common toucan","Giant toucan","Toucan"],"spreading":[{"name":"South America","area":"CENTRAL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"South America","area":"EAST","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Toco toucan call.","samplePath":"atlas/ramphastos-toco/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/ramphastos-toco/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ramphastos-toco/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"lifespan","value":0.0,"maximum":6.3113904E8,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"Up to 20 years"},{"name":"length","value":0.64,"maximum":null,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"64 cm"},{"name":"length.bill","value":0.19,"maximum":null,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Bill Length","valueDisplay":"19 cm"},{"name":"weight","value":0.57,"maximum":null,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"570 grams"},{"name":"wingspan","value":0.6,"maximum":null,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"60 cm"},{"name":"speed","value":8.3333,"maximum":null,"quantity":"SPEED","nameDisplay":"Speed","valueDisplay":"30 km/h"},{"name":"elevation","value":0.0,"maximum":1750.0,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Elevation","valueDisplay":"Up to 1.75 km"}],"related":[{"index":10,"display":"Blue-and-yellow macaw","definition":"The blue-and-yellow macaw is a large South American parrot with mostly blue top parts and light orange underparts, with gradient hues of green on top of its head.","iconPath":"atlas/ara-ararauna/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":11,"display":"Budgerigar","definition":"The budgerigar is a long-tailed, seed-eating parrot usually nicknamed the budgie, or in American English, the parakeet.","iconPath":"atlas/melopsittacus-undulatus/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":49,"display":"Red-tailed black cockatoo","definition":"The red-tailed black cockatoo is a large black cockatoo native to Australia.
