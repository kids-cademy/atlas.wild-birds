{"index":1,"rank":0,"name":"vultur-gryphus","display":"Andean condor","definition":"The Andean condor is a South American bird in the New World vulture family Cathartidae and is the only member of the genus Vultur.","description":"<p>Found in the Andes mountains and adjacent Pacific coasts of western South America, the Andean condor is the largest flying bird in the world by combined measurement of weight and wingspan.</p><p>It is a large black vulture with a ruff of white feathers surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings.</p><p>The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state.</p><p>In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most birds of prey, the male is larger than the female.</p><p>Andean condors are massive birds, among the largest in the world that are able to fly. </p><p>Because they are so heavy, even their enormous wingspan needs some help to keep them aloft. For that reason, these birds prefer to live in windy areas where they can glide on air currents with little effort.</p><p>It reaches sexual maturity at five or six years of age and nests at elevations of up to 5,000 m, generally on inaccessible rock ledges. One or two eggs are usually laid.</p><p>It is one of the world's longest-living birds, with a lifespan of over 70 years in some cases.</p><p>Condors are vultures, so they keep their sharp eyes peeled for the carrion that makes up most of their diet.</p><p>They prefer to feast on large animals, wild or domestic, and in picking the carcasses, they perform an important function as a natural clean-up crew. </p><p>The Andean condor is a national symbol of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru and plays an important role in the folklore and mythology of the Andean regions.</p><p>The Andean condor is considered near threatened by the IUCN.</p><p>It is threatened by habitat loss and by secondary poisoning from carcasses killed by hunters.</p><p>Captive breeding programs have been instituted in several countries.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/vultur-gryphus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/vultur-gryphus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/vultur-gryphus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/vultur-gryphus/cover.png","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/vultur-gryphus/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/vultur-gryphus/featured.png","caption":"<p>The
