{"index":59,"rank":0,"name":"setophaga-petechia","display":"Yellow warbler","definition":"A small, bright yellow migratory warbler that breeds throughout North and Central America.","description":"<p>The bright, sweet song of the yellow warbler is a familiar sound in streamside willows and woodland edges. </p><p>This is one of our most widely distributed warblers, nesting from the Arctic Circle to Mexico, with closely related forms along tropical coastlines.</p><p>Yellow warbler are the most extensively yellow of warblers, with golden yellow plumage and rusty streaks on the breast. </p><p>Males and females are pretty similar, with golden yellow upper parts tinged with olive, yellow under parts, and thin pointed beaks. </p><p>Males are generally brighter, especially during the breeding season. </p><p>Yellow warblers prefer moist habitats because they offer a large variety of insects. </p><p>These habitats include the edges of marshes and swamps, willow-lined streams, and leafy bogs. </p><p>Yellow warblers also inhabit dry areas such as thickets, orchards, farmlands, forest edges, and suburban yards and gardens. </p><p>They prefer areas of scattered trees, dense shrubbery and any other moist, shady areas.</p><p>Yellow warblers mostly eat insects but will occasionally also eat some berries. </p><p>They forage for insects and spiders on the limbs of trees and bushes. </p><p>Small insect larvae and caterpillars are preferred foods.</p><p>Yellow warblers usually breed in late May and early June. </p><p>They nest in trees, building a small but very sturdy cup shaped nest. </p><p>Females lay 4 to 5 eggs, incubation lasting from 10 to 14 days.</p><p>Nestling period lasts from 8 to 12 days, and parental feeding may extend to two weeks after the young leave the nest.</p><p>Females and males first attempt to breed in their first year after hatching. </p><p>Both sexes rear the young about equally, but emphasize different tasks.</p><p>Females are more involved with building and maintaining the nest, and incubating and brooding the offspring. </p><p>Males are more involved in guarding the nest site and procuring food, bringing it to the nest and passing it to the waiting mother, which does most of the actual feeding. </p><p>The song is a musical strophe that can be rendered \"sweet sweet sweet, I'm so sweet\", although it varies considerably between populations. </p><p>The call is a soft or harder \"chip or ship\". This is particularly frequently given by females after a male has finished his song.</p><p>The predators of yellow warblers are those typical of such smallish tree-nesting passerines: snakes, foxes, birds of prey, and many others.</p><p>Snakes are significant nest predators, taking nestlings and fledglings as well as sick or distracted adults.</p><p>Likewise corvids and large climbing rodents, notably the American red squirrel.</p><p>Carnivores, including the striped skunk, long-tailed weasel and common raccoon; the red fox and domestic or feral cats, are similarly opportunistic predators.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/setophaga-petechia/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/setophaga-petechia/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/setophaga-petechia/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/setophaga-petechia/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/setophaga-petechia/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/setophaga-petechia/featured.png","caption":"<p>Yellow warbler preferred foods are small insect larvae and caterpillars.</p>\n<p>Up to two-thirds of diet may be caterpillars of various kinds.</p>\n"},"icon":{"path":"atlas/setophaga-petechia/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/setophaga-petechia/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T13:55:51Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Passeriformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Parulidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Setophaga"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Setophaga petechia"}],"aliases":["Mangrove warbler"],"spreading":[{"name":"North America","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Central America","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Yellow warbler song","samplePath":"atlas/setophaga-petechia/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/setophaga-petechia/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/setophaga-petechia/waveform.png","facts":[{"name":"Cowbird is a brood parasite","value":"Brown-headed cowbirds lay their eggs in the nests of yellow warblers.
