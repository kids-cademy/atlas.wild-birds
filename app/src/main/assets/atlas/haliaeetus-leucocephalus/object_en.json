{"index":5,"rank":0,"name":"haliaeetus-leucocephalus","display":"Bald eagle","definition":"A North American eagle characterized by a brownish-black body and a white head and tail in the adult.","description":"<p>The bald eagle is a bird of prey found in North America.</p><p>Bald eagles are not actually bald; the name derives from an older meaning of the word, \"white headed\".</p><p>The plumage of an adult bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. </p><p>The beak is large and hooked. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped. </p><p>The sexes are identical in plumage coloration, but sexual dimorphism is evident in the species, in that females are 25% larger than males.</p><p>Immature eagles are dark, and until they are about five years old, they lack the distinctive white markings that make their parents so easy to identify.</p><p>Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico.</p><p>Bald eagles prefer living in areas close to bodies of water, as their favorite prey is fish. </p><p>They can be found in wetlands, on the coasts, near lakes or rivers, and in marshes.</p><p>The vast majority of a bald eagle’s diet consists of fish.</p><p>Many populations will rely heavily on the spawning behaviors of fish, like salmon and trout for their diet.</p><p>These powerful birds of prey use their talons to fish, but they get many of their meals by scavenging carrion or stealing the kills of other animals.</p><p>Sexual maturity is attained at the age of four to five years. </p><p>Bald eagles are believed to mate for life.  </p><p>They build the largest nest of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species.</p><p>The nest is up to 4 meters deep, 2.5 meters wide, and has one metric ton in weight.</p><p>Compared to most other raptors bald eagles are early breeders: nest building is by mid-February, egg laying is often late February, and incubation is usually mid-March and early May. </p><p>Eggs hatch from mid April to early May, and the young fledge late June to early July.</p><p>Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs, but the female does most of the sitting. </p><p>The parent not incubating will hunt for food or look for nesting material during this stage. </p><p>In the late 20th century it was on the brink of extirpation in the contiguous United States.</p><p>Populations have since recovered and the species was removed from the U.S. government's list of endangered species on July 12, 1995 and transferred to the list of threatened species.</p><p>It was removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the contiguous states on June 28, 2007.</p><p>The bald eagle is the national bird of the United States of America.
