{"index":44,"rank":0,"name":"anas-platyrhynchos","display":"Mallard","definition":"A wild duck found almost worldwide, the male of which has a green head and neck. Most domestic ducks descend from the mallard.","description":"<p>Mallard belongs to the waterfowl family and is the main ancestor of most breeds of domesticated ducks.</p><p>The male birds (drakes) have a glossy green head and are grey on their wings and belly, while the females have mainly brown-speckled plumage.</p><p>Both sexes have an area of white-bordered black or iridescent blue feathers called a speculum on their wings; males especially tend to have blue speculum feathers.</p><p>The mallard is 50 to 65 centimeters long, of which the body makes up around two-thirds the length.</p><p>It is often slightly heavier than most other dabbling ducks, weighing 700 grams to 1.6 kilograms.</p><p>Mallard prefers wetlands, where productive waters produce large amounts of floating, emergent and submerged vegetation. </p><p>Wetlands also produce a great deal of aquatic invertebrates on which mallards feed.</p><p>They can be found in many types of habitats throughout the country including lakes, rivers, streams, small ponds, swamps, marshlands, and water reservoirs.</p><p>Mallards consume a wide variety of foods, including vegetation, insects, worms, gastropods and arthropods, although they are not restricted to these. </p><p>They also take advantage of human food sources, such as gleaning grain from crops.</p><p>Most mallard hens breed as yearlings, but they may not have much success; studies show that older hens have much lower duckling mortality. </p><p>Pair bonding starts as early as October and continues through March. Males leave the hen soon after mating. </p><p>The hen usually lays 9  to 13 eggs in a nest on the ground near a body of water.  Ducklings hatch after 26 to 28 days.</p><p>Newly hatched mallard ducks are capable of swimming, walking, and communicating with their mother. </p><p>Once hatched the female leads her ducklings to the water and abandons the nest. </p><p>The young ducklings stay with their mother for about 8 weeks, then become independent.</p><p>After the breeding season mallards form groups called flocks and migrate from colder, northern areas to warmer, southern areas. </p><p>Some mallards, however, may choose to stay through the winter in areas where there is enough food and shelter. </p><p>Mallards are diurnal, which means that they are most active during the day.</p><p>Mallards are preyed upon by a wide variety of predators, including humans, raccoons, cats, domestic dog, skunks, weasels, hawks, crows, ravens, magpies, turtles, snakes, and fish. </p><p>They are watchful and escape to the water when startled, including the young ducklings.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/anas-platyrhynchos/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/anas-platyrhynchos/cover.png","caption":"<p>qqqqq</p>"},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/anas-platyrhynchos/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/anas-platyrhynchos/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/anas-platyrhynchos/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/anas-platyrhynchos/featured.png","caption":"<p>Sexes are easily distinguished by color:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>males have green heads, white collars and brown chests,</li>\n<li>females are almost entirely covered with brown feathers.</li>\n</ul>\n"},"icon":{"path":"atlas/anas-platyrhynchos/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/anas-platyrhynchos/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T13:14:45Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Anseriformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Anatidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Anas"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Anas platyrhynchos"}],"aliases":["Common mallard","Northen mallard"],"spreading":[{"name":"Northern hemisphere","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Mallard duck call","samplePath":"atlas/anas-platyrhynchos/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/anas-platyrhynchos/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/anas-platyrhynchos/waveform.png","facts":[{"name":"Mallard ducks are omnivores","value":"Mallard ducks are omnivores (eat plants and other animals).
