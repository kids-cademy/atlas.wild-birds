{"index":40,"rank":0,"name":"pelecanus-onocrotalus","display":"Great white pelican","definition":"The great white pelican also known as the eastern white pelican, rosy pelican or white pelican is a bird in the pelican family.","description":"<p>The great white pelican is a huge bird. </p><p>It measures 140 to 180 centimeters in length with a 28.9 to 47.1 centimeters enormous pink and yellow bill, and a dull pale-yellow gular pouch.</p><p>The wingspan measures 226 to 360 centimeters, the latter measurement being the highest among extant flying animals outside of the great albatross.</p><p>The plumage is predominantly white except on remiges, with a faint pink tinge on the neck and a yellowish base on the foreneck.</p><p>Great white pelicans usually prefer shallow, warm fresh water. </p><p>In Eurasia, fresh or brackish waters may be inhabited and the pelicans may be found in lakes, deltas, lagoons and marshes, usually with dense reed beds nearby for nesting purposes.</p><p>In Africa, great white pelicans occur mainly around freshwater and alkaline lakes and may also be found in coastal, estuarine areas.</p><p>The great white pelican mainly eats fish. It needs from 0.9 to 1.4 kilograms of fish every day.</p><p>Fish targeted are usually fairly large ones, in the 500 to 600 grams weight range, and are taken based on regional abundance.</p><p>Common carp are preferred in Europe, mullets in China, and Arabian toothcarp in India. In Africa, often the commonest cichlids seem to be preferred.</p><p>They feed in groups, often cooperatively - which is rare among birds. </p><p>A group of 8 to 12 pelicans get in a horseshoe formation on the water; they surround and force fish into shallow water, flapping wings and plunging bills to catch the fish along the way. </p><p>When it catches a fish, the pelican tilts its bill up and swallows the fish whole.</p><p>Large numbers of these pelicans breed together in colonies.</p><p>Some populations make stick nests in trees but the majority nest in scrapes on the ground, lined with grass, sticks, feathers and other material.</p><p>The female can lay from 1 to 4 eggs in a clutch, with two being the average.</p><p>Incubation takes 29 to 36 days. The chicks are naked when they hatch but quickly sprout blackish-brown down. </p><p>The young are cared for by both parents and fledge at 65 to 75 days of age. </p><p>The great white pelican is highly sociable and often forms large colonies.</p><p>As is common in pelicans, the close approach of a large mammal, including a human, at a colony will lead the pelican to abandon its nest in self-preservation.</p><p>It is well adapted for aquatic life. The short strong legs and webbed feet propel it in water and aid a rather awkward takeoff from the water surface. </p><p>Great white pelicans are often protected from bird-eating raptors by virtue of their own great size.</p><p>Anyway, eagles may prey on their eggs, nestlings, and fledglings. Occasionally, pelicans and their young are attacked at their colonies by mammalian carnivores, such as jackals and lions.</p><p>Additionally, crocodiles, especially Nile crocodiles in Africa, readily kill and eat swimming pelicans.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/pelecanus-onocrotalus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/pelecanus-onocrotalus/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/pelecanus-onocrotalus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/pelecanus-onocrotalus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/pelecanus-onocrotalus/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/pelecanus-onocrotalus/featured.png","caption":"<p>In flight, the great white pleican is an elegant soaring bird, with the head held close to and aligned with the body. </p><p>Its flight consists of a few slow wingbeats followed by a glide.</p>"},"icon":{"path":"atlas/pelecanus-onocrotalus/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/pelecanus-onocrotalus/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T10:48:45Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Pelecaniformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Pelecanidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Pelecanus"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Pelecanus onocrotalus"}],"aliases":["Eastern white pelican","Rosy pelican","White pelican"],"spreading":[{"name":"Africa","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Europe","area":"EAST","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Asia","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Great white pelican call","samplePath":"atlas/pelecanus-onocrotalus/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/pelecanus-onocrotalus/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/pelecanus-onocrotalus/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"lifespan","value":8.52037704E8,"maximum":null,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"27 years"},{"name":"lifespan.captivity","value":1.609404552E9,"maximum":null,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan in Captivity","valueDisplay":"51 years"},{"name":"length","value":1.4,"maximum":1.8,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"1.4 to 1.8 m"},{"name":"wingspan","value":2.26,"maximum":3.6,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"2.26 to 3.6 m"},{"name":"weight","value":5.4,"maximum":15.0,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"5.4 to 15 kg"},{"name":"speed.full","value":18.0556,"maximum":null,"quantity":"SPEED","nameDisplay":"Full Speed","valueDisplay":"65 km/h"},{"name":"length.bill","value":0.289,"maximum":0.471,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Bill Length","valueDisplay":"28.9 to 47.1 cm"},{"name":"elevation","value":0.0,"maximum":1372.0,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Elevation","valueDisplay":"Up to 1.37 km"}],"related":[{"index":37,"display":"Great blue heron","definition":"The great blue heron is a large wading bird in the heron family Ardeidae, common near the shores of open water and in weatlands.","iconPath":"atlas/ardea-herodias/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":38,"display":"Great egret","definition":"The great egrets are white herons of the genera Ardea, characteristically having long, showy plumes during the breeding season.","iconPath":"atlas/ardea-alba/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":33,"display":"Eurasian spoonbill","definition":"The Eurasian spoonbill is a wading bird of the ibis and spoonbill family Threskiornithidae.","iconPath":"atlas/platalea-leucorodia/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":4,"display":"Australian white ibis","definition":"The Australian white ibis is a wading bird of the ibis family.
