It has mottled gray instead of white on the underside of its flight feathers.</p><p>The California condor's head and neck have few feathers.</p><p>The skin of the head and neck is capable of flushing noticeably in response to emotional state, a capability that can serve as communication between individuals.</p><p>The skin color varies from yellowish to a glowing reddish-orange. </p><p>The birds do not have true syringeal vocalizations. They can make a few hissing or grunting sounds only heard when very close.</p><p>The California condor is a scavenger and eats large amounts of carrion.</p><p>They prefer the carcasses of large dead animals like deer, cattle and sheep, as well as marine mammals that have washed up on the shore along the coastline.</p><p>This condors have high calcium needs and actively collect and eat bones and other calcium-rich objects like bones from smaller carcasses (rodents), shells and shellfish.</p><p>It is one of the world's longest-living birds, with a lifespan of up to 60 years.</p><p>Condors begin to look for a mate when they reach sexual maturity at the age of six.</p><p>To attract a prospective mate, the male condor performs a display, in which the male turns his head red and puffs out his neck feathers. </p><p>He then spreads his wings and slowly approaches the female. </p><p>If the female lowers her head to accept the male, the condors become mates for life. </p><p>The pair makes a simple nest in caves or on cliff clefts, especially ones with nearby roosting trees and open spaces for landing. </p><p>A mated female lays one bluish-white egg every other year.</p><p>The eggs hatch after 53 to 60 days of incubation by both parents. </p><p>Chicks are born with their eyes open and sometimes can take up to a week to leave the shell completely.</p><p>This condor became extinct in the wild in 1987 when all remaining wild individuals were captured.</p><p>Since then, he was reintroduced to northern Arizona and southern Utah - including the Grand Canyon area and Zion National Park, the coastal mountains of central and southern California, and northern Baja California.</p><p>Numbers rose through captive breeding and, beginning in 1991, condors were reintroduced into the wild.</p><p>Since then, its population has grown, but the California condor remains one of the world's rarest bird species: as of 2017 there are 463 California condors living wild or in captivity, while in 2018 they reached 488.</p><p>The condor is a significant bird to many Californian Native American groups and plays an important role in several of their traditional myths.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/gymnogyps-californianus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/gymnogyps-californianus/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/gymnogyps-californianus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/gymnogyps-californianus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/gymnogyps-californianus/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/gymnogyps-californianus/featured.png","caption":"<p>At its about 3 m wingspan is the widest of any North American bird, and its weight of up to 12 kg makes it the heaviest among native North American bird species.</p>"},"icon":{"path":"atlas/gymnogyps-californianus/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/gymnogyps-californianus/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T02:51:20Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Accipitriformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Cathartidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Gymnogyps"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Gymnogyps californianus"}],"aliases":[],"spreading":[{"name":"Grand Canyon","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Zion National Park","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Costal mountains of California","area":"WEST","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Baja California","area":"NORTH","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":{"value":2.5,"mask":132102},"endDate":null,"conservation":"CR","sampleTitle":null,"samplePath":null,"waveformPath":null,"waveformSrc":null,"facts":[{"name":"California condor is very large bird","value":"California condor is very large bird.
