Occasionally, adults are seen with yellow/grey legs. </p><p>Common murres have fast direct flight but are not very agile.</p><p>They are more manoeuvrable underwater, typically diving to depths of 30 to 60 meters.</p><p>Depths of up to 180 meters have been recorded.</p><p>Common murre spends most of its time at sea, only coming to land to breed. </p><p>It rests on the water in the winter and this may have consequences for their metabolism.</p><p>The breeding habitat is islands, rocky shores, cliffs and sea stacks.</p><p>Cape Meares, Oregon is home to one of the most populous colonies of nesting common murres on the continent.</p><p>Common murres breed in colonies at high densities.</p><p>Nesting pairs may be in bodily contact with their neighbours.</p><p>They make no nest; their single egg is incubated on a bare rock ledge on a cliff face.</p><p>Eggs hatch after around 30 days incubation.</p><p>The chick is born downy and can regulate its body temperature after 10 days.</p><p>Some 20 days after hatching the chick leaves its nesting ledge and heads for the sea, accompanied by its male parent.</p><p>Being unable to fly, the chick glides the distance, fluttering his wings.</p><p>Chicks are capable of diving as soon as they hit the water.</p><p>The female stays at the nest site for some 14 days after the chick has left.</p><p>Both male and female common murres moult after breeding and become flightless for 1–2 months.</p><p>In southern populations they occasionally return to the nest site throughout the winter.</p><p>Northern populations spend the winter farther from their colonies.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/uria-aalge/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/uria-aalge/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/uria-aalge/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/uria-aalge/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/uria-aalge/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/uria-aalge/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-25T03:02:39Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Charadriiformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Alcidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Uria"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Uria aalge"}],"aliases":["Common guillemot","Northern guillemot","Guillemot"],"spreading":[],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Common murre colony","samplePath":"atlas/uria-aalge/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/uria-aalge/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/uria-aalge/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"lifespan","value":6.3113904E8,"maximum":null,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"20 years"},{"name":"lifespan.record","value":1.199164176E9,"maximum":null,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan Record","valueDisplay":"38 years"},{"name":"length","value":0.38,"maximum":0.46,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"38 to 46 cm"},{"name":"wingspan","value":0.61,"maximum":0.73,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"61 to 73 cm"},{"name":"depth","value":30.0,"maximum":60.0,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Diving Depth","valueDisplay":"30 to 60 m"},{"name":"weight","value":0.945,"maximum":1.044,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"945 grams to 1.04 kg"}],"related":[{"index":3,"display":"Atlantic puffin","definition":"The Atlantic puffin is a species of seabird in the auk family.","iconPath":"atlas/fratercula-arctica/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null}],"links":[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_murre","display":"Wikipedia","description":"Wikipedia article about common murre.","iconPath":"link/wikipedia.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/wikipedia.png"},{"url":"https://ebird.org/species/commur/","display":"eBird","description":"eBird observations about common murre.","iconPath":"link/ebird.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/ebird.png"},{"url":"https://www.britannica.com/animal/murre#ref13530","display":"Encyclopædia Britannica","description":"Murre article on Britannica.","iconPath":"link/britannica.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/britannica.png"},{"url":"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22694841/60108623","display":"IUCN Red List","description":"IUCN Red List index of common murre.","iconPath":"link/iucnredlist.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/iucnredlist.png"},{"url":"https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=176974#null","display":"Taxonomic Information System","description":"ITIS taxonomy for common murre.","iconPath":"link/itis.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/itis.png"},{"url":"https://eol.org/pages/45509343","display":"Encyclopedia of Life","description":"Data, maps and articles about common murre.","iconPath":"link/eol.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/eol.png"},{"url":"https://www.thefreedictionary.com/murre","display":"The Free Dictionary","description":"Common murre definition on dictionary.","iconPath":"link/thefreedictionary.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/thefreedictionary.png"}]}
