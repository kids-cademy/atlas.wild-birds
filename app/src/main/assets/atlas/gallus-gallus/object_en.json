{"index":48,"rank":0,"name":"gallus-gallus","display":"Red junglefowl","definition":"The red junglefowl is a tropical bird in the family Phasianidae and is the primary progenitor of the domestic chicken.","description":"<p>The red junglefowl has a mix of feather colours, with orange, brown, red, gold, grey, white, olive and even metallic green plumage. </p><p>The tail of the male roosters can grow up to 28 centimetres, and the whole bird may be as long as 70 centimetres. </p><p>Male junglefowl are significantly larger than females, and have brightly coloured decorative feathers. </p><p>Compared to the more familiar domestic chicken, the red junglefowl has a much smaller body mass and is brighter in coloration. </p><p>Female weights almost one kilogram whereas the male can reach 1.45 kilograms.</p><p>Red junglefowl prefer disturbed habitats and edges, both natural and those created by humans. </p><p>Apparently the forage, and thick cover in these sorts of areas are attractive to junglefowl, especially nesting females. </p><p>They use logged and regenerating forests and often are found near human settlements and areas regenerating from slash-and-burn cultivation.  </p><p>Red junglefowls are omnivorous by nature. Their diet comprises insects, especially termites and winged ants that emerge at dawn and dusk. </p><p>It also rakes the ground in search of arthropods and other invertebrates, and small vertebrates such as lizards.</p><p>They are also attracted to areas with ripe fruit or seeds, including fruit plantations, fields of domestic grain, and stands of bamboo.</p><p>Although junglefowl typically eat fallen fruits and seeds on the ground, they occasionally forage in trees, perching on branches and feeding on hanging fruit.</p><p>Males make a food-related display called \"tidbitting\", performed upon finding food in the presence of a female.</p><p>The display usually ends when the hen takes the food item either from the ground or directly from the male's beak. Mating then sometimes occurs.</p><p>During the laying period, red junglefowl females lay an egg every day. Eggs take 21 days to develop. </p><p>Chicks fledge in about 4 to 5 weeks, and at 12 weeks old are chased out of the group by their mother. </p><p>Dominant males attempt to maintain exclusive reproductive access to females.</p><p>Red junglefowl regularly bathe in dust to keep just the right balance in their plumage. The dust absorbs the extra oil that subsequently falls off.</p><p>The flight of these birds is almost confined for reaching their roosting areas at sunset, and for escape from an immediate danger through the day.</p><p>Dominant male junglefowl appear to defend a territory against other dominant males.</p><p>The red junglefowls were first domesticated at least 5,000 years ago in India.</p><p>Since then, their domestic form has spread around the world and is kept globally as a very productive food source of both meat and eggs.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/gallus-gallus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/gallus-gallus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/gallus-gallus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/gallus-gallus/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/gallus-gallus/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/gallus-gallus/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-25T02:51:10Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Galliformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Phasianidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Gallus"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Gallus gallus"}],"aliases":["Gamecock","Jungle Fowl"],"spreading":[{"name":"Asia","area":"SOUTH","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Red junglefowl call","samplePath":"atlas/gallus-gallus/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/gallus-gallus/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/gallus-gallus/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"lifespan","value":9.4670856E8,"maximum":null,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"30 years"},{"name":"length","value":0.64,"maximum":0.71,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"64 to 71 cm"},{"name":"length.tail","value":0.28,"maximum":null,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Tail Length","valueDisplay":"28 cm"},{"name":"wingspan","value":0.38,"maximum":0.51,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"38 to 51 cm"},{"name":"weight","value":0.0,"maximum":1.45,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"Up to 1.45 kg"},{"name":"elevation","value":2000.0,"maximum":null,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Elevation","valueDisplay":"2 km"}],"related":[{"index":43,"display":"Indian peafowl","definition":"The Indian peafowl is a large and brightly coloured bird, is a species of peafowl native to the Indian subcontinent, but introduced in many other parts of the world.","iconPath":"atlas/pavo-cristatus/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":23,"display":"Common pheasant","definition":"The common pheasant is a bird in the pheasant family.
