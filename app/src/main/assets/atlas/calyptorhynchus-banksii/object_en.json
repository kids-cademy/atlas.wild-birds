{"index":49,"rank":0,"name":"calyptorhynchus-banksii","display":"Red-tailed black cockatoo","definition":"The red-tailed black cockatoo is a large black cockatoo native to Australia. It is more common in the drier parts of the continent.","description":"<p>Of the black cockatoos, the red-tailed is the most adaptable to aviculture, although black cockatoos are much rarer and much more expensive in aviculture outside Australia.</p><p>The male's plumage is all black with a prominent black crest made up of elongated feathers from the forehead and crown. </p><p>The bill is dark grey. The tail is also black with two lateral bright red panels. </p><p>Adult males have a characteristic pair of bright red panels on the tail that gives the species its name.</p><p>Females are black with yellow-orange stripes in the tail and chest, and yellow grading to red spots on the cheeks and wings. </p><p>Red-tailed black cockatoos are around 60 centimetres in length and sexually dimorphic. </p><p>Male birds weigh between 670 and 920 grams, while females weigh slightly less at 615 to 870 grams. </p><p>In common with other cockatoos and parrots, red-tailed black cockatoos have zygodactyl feet, two toes facing forward and two backward.</p><p>This allow them to grasp objects with one foot while standing on the other, for feeding and manipulation. </p><p>Although red-tailed black cockatoos feed on a wide variety of native and introduced grains, the mainstay of their diet is eucalyptus seeds. </p><p>Cockatoos bite off branchlets with clusters of seed capsules, then hold them with their feet while chewing and harvesting seeds before littering the ground with debris. </p><p>Among other seeds and nuts consumed are those of acacia, allocasuarina, banksia, grevillea and hakea.</p><p>They also consume berries, fruits and various insects.</p><p>The male red-tailed black cockatoo courts by puffing up crest and cheek feathers, and hiding the beak.</p><p>It then sings and struts, ending in a jump and a flash of red tail feathers toward the female who will most often reply by defensively biting him.</p><p>Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees. </p><p>Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. </p><p>The same tree may be used for many years. </p><p>A clutch consists of 1 to 2 white, lustreless eggs, although the second chick is in most cases neglected and perishes in infancy.</p><p>Several calls of red-tailed black cockatoos have been recorded. </p><p>The bird's contact call is a rolling metallic krur-rr or kree, which may carry long distances and is always given while flying; its alarm call is sharp. </p><p>Displaying males vocalize a sequence of soft growling followed by a repetitive kred-kred-kred-kred.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/calyptorhynchus-banksii/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/calyptorhynchus-banksii/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/calyptorhynchus-banksii/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/calyptorhynchus-banksii/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/calyptorhynchus-banksii/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/calyptorhynchus-banksii/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T13:41:04Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Psittaciformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Psittacidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Calyptorhynchus"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Calyptorhynchus banksii"}],"aliases":["Banksian cockatoo","Banks' black cockatoo"],"spreading":[{"name":"Australia","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Red-tailed black cockatoo calls","samplePath":"atlas/calyptorhynchus-banksii/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/calyptorhynchus-banksii/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/calyptorhynchus-banksii/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"lifespan","value":6.3113904E8,"maximum":null,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"20 years"},{"name":"lifespan.captivity","value":1.42006284E9,"maximum":1.5778476E9,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan in Captivity","valueDisplay":"45 to 50 years"},{"name":"length","value":0.6,"maximum":null,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"60 cm"},{"name":"weight","value":0.615,"maximum":0.92,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"615 to 920 grams"},{"name":"speed.full","value":19.4444,"maximum":null,"quantity":"SPEED","nameDisplay":"Full Speed","valueDisplay":"70 km/h"}],"related":[{"index":10,"display":"Blue-and-yellow macaw","definition":"The blue-and-yellow macaw is a large South American parrot with mostly blue top parts and light orange underparts, with gradient hues of green on top of its head.","iconPath":"atlas/ara-ararauna/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":11,"display":"Budgerigar","definition":"The budgerigar is a long-tailed, seed-eating parrot usually nicknamed the budgie, or in American English, the parakeet.","iconPath":"atlas/melopsittacus-undulatus/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null}],"links":[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-tailed_black_cockatoo","display":"Wikipedia","description":"Wikipedia article about red-tailed black cockatoo.","iconPath":"link/wikipedia.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/wikipedia.png"},{"url":"https://ebird.org/species/rtbcoc1/","display":"eBird","description":"eBird observations about red-tailed black cockatoo.","iconPath":"link/ebird.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/ebird.png"},{"url":"https://www.britannica.com/animal/cockatoo","display":"Encyclop√¶dia Britannica","description":"Cockatoos article on Britannica.","iconPath":"link/britannica.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/britannica.png"},{"url":"http://animalia.bio/red-tailed-cockatoo","display":"ANIMALIA","description":"Animalia article avout red-tailed black cockatoo.","iconPath":"link/animalia.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/animalia.png"},{"url":"https://kids.kiddle.co/Cockatoo","display":"Kiddle","description":"Red-tailed black cockatoo facts for kids.","iconPath":"link/kiddle.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/kiddle.png"},{"url":"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22684744/93044811","display":"IUCN Red List","description":"IUCN Red List index of red-tailed black cockatoo.","iconPath":"link/iucnredlist.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/iucnredlist.png"},{"url":"https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=554835#null","display":"Taxonomic Information System","description":"ITIS taxonomy for red-tailed black cockatoo.","iconPath":"link/itis.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/itis.png"},{"url":"https://eol.org/pages/1177834","display":"Encyclopedia of Life","description":"Data, maps and articles about red-tailed black cockatoo.","iconPath":"link/eol.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/eol.png"},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Feed-a-Cockatoo","display":"wikiHow","description":"How to Feed a Cockatoo","iconPath":"link/wikihow.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/wikihow.png"},{"url":"https://www.thefreedictionary.com/cockatoo","display":"The Free Dictionary","description":"Red-tailed black cockatoo definition on dictionary.","iconPath":"link/thefreedictionary.png","iconSrc":"/media/link/thefreedictionary.png"}]}
