{"index":42,"rank":0,"name":"passer-domesticus","display":"House sparrow","definition":"The house sparrow is a bird of the sparrow family Passeridae, found in most parts of the world.","description":"<p>It is a small bird that has a typical length of 16 centimers and a mass of 24 to 9.5 grams.</p><p>Females and young birds are colored pale brown and grey, and males have brighter black, white, and brown markings. Underparts are pale pearly-gray. </p><p>One of about 25 species in the genus Passer, the house sparrow is native to most of Europe, the Mediterranean Basin, and a large part of Asia.</p><p>Its intentional or accidental introductions to many regions, including parts of Australasia, Africa, and the Americas, make it the most widely distributed wild bird.</p><p>It was introduced into North America at Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1852 and within a century had spread across the continent. </p><p>The house sparrow is strongly associated with human habitation, and can live in urban or rural settings.</p><p>Though found in widely varied habitats and climates, it typically avoids extensive woodlands, grasslands, and deserts away from human development.</p><p>It feeds mostly on the seeds of grains and weeds, but it is an opportunistic eater and commonly eats insects and many other foods.</p><p>Its predators include domestic cats, hawks, owls, and many other predatory birds and mammals.</p><p>House sparrows form monogamous pairs for each breeding season. Nests are built between February and May. </p><p>They nest in crevices inside and on buildings, and in coniferous and deciduous trees. Nests are built from dried vegetation, feathers, strings, and paper. </p><p>Eggs are layed at any time in the nesting period. One to eight eggs can be present in a clutch, with the possiblity of four clutches per nesting season. </p><p>Incubation begins after all the eggs have been layed. Both males and females incubate the eggs for short periods of a few minutes each. </p><p>Incubation lasts for 10 to 14 days. After the eggs are hatched, both males and females feed the young through regurgitation.</p><p>Because of its numbers, ubiquity, and association with human settlements, the house sparrow is culturally prominent.</p><p>It is extensively, and usually unsuccessfully, persecuted as an agricultural pest.</p><p>It has also often been kept as a pet, as well as being a food item and a symbol of lust, sexual potency, commonness, and vulgarity.</p><p>Though it is widespread and abundant, its numbers have declined in some areas.</p><p>The animal's conservation status is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/passer-domesticus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/passer-domesticus/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/passer-domesticus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/passer-domesticus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/passer-domesticus/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/passer-domesticus/featured.png","caption":"<p>The top of a male sparrow's head is dark gray lined with streaks of vibrant chestnut, while a female's head is more dusty brown in color.</p><p>Look at the throat.
