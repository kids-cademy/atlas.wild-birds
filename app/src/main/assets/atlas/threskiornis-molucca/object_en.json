{"index":4,"rank":0,"name":"threskiornis-molucca","display":"Australian white ibis","definition":"The Australian white ibis is a wading bird of the ibis family. It is widespread across much of Australia.","description":"<p>The Australian ibis is a sister species of the African sacred ibis.</p><p>The Australian white ibis is a fairly large ibis species, around 65 to 75 centimeters long.</p><p>It has a bald black head and neck and a long black downcurved beak, measuring up to 16.7 centimeters. </p><p>The body plumage is white although it may become brown-stained. Inner secondary plumes are displayed as lacy black tail feathers. </p><p>The upper tail becomes yellow when the bird is breeding. </p><p>The legs and feet are dark and red skin is visible on the underside of the wing. </p><p>There is some sexual dimorphism in size, as the slightly heavier male weighs 1.7 to 2.5 kilograms compared to the 1.4 to 1.9 kilograms female.</p><p>As a comparison, the American white ibis generally attains 1 kilograms in weight.</p><p>Historically rare in urban areas, the Australian white ibis has migrated to urban areas of the east coast in increasing numbers since the late 1970s.</p><p>Populations have disappeared from natural breeding areas such as the Macquarie Marshes in northern New South Wales.</p><p>The Australian white ibis' range of food includes both terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates and human scraps. </p><p>The most favoured foods are crayfish and mussels, which the bird obtains by digging with its long bill. </p><p>The Australian white ibis reaches sexual maturity in three years.</p><p>Breeding season varies with the location within Australia, generally August to November in the south, and February to May, after the wet season, in the north. </p><p>The nest is a shallow dish-shaped platform of sticks, grasses or reeds, located in trees and generally near a body of water such as river, swamp or lake. </p><p>Ibises commonly nest near other waterbirds such as egrets, herons, spoonbills or cormorants. </p><p>Two to three dull white eggs are laid, measuring 65 on 44 millimeters. The clutch is then incubated for 21 to 23 days.</p><p>Hatchlings are altricial, that is, they are naked and helpless at birth, and take 48 days to fledge.</p><p>Due to its increasing presence in the urban environment and its habit of rummaging in garbage, the species has acquired a variety of colloquial names such as \"tip turkey\" and \"bin chicken\".</p><p>There has been debate in recent years over whether to consider them a pest or a possibly endangered species. </p><p>--------------------</p><p>Immature birds have shorter bills.[14] </p><p>The head and neck are feathered in juveniles.</p><p>The call is a long croak.[14]</p><p>,[12] and can reach twenty-eight years of age.[5] </p><p>-------------------</p><p>\nManagement plans have been introduced to control problematic urban populations in Sydney.</p><p>Due to its increasing presence in the urban environment and its habit of rummaging in garbage, the species has acquired a variety of colloquial names such as \"tip turkey\" and \"bin chicken\", and in recent years has become an icon of popular culture, being regarded \"with passion, wit, and, in equal measure, affection and disgust\".</p><p>It is known as mardungurra among the Yindjibarndi people of the central and western Pilbara.</p><p>--------------------------</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/threskiornis-molucca/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/threskiornis-molucca/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/threskiornis-molucca/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/threskiornis-molucca/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/threskiornis-molucca/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/threskiornis-molucca/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-25T17:47:26Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Pelecaniformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Threskiornithidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Threskiornis"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Threskiornis
