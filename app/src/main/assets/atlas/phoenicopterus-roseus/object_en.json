{"index":41,"rank":0,"name":"phoenicopterus-roseus","display":"Greater flamingo","definition":"The greater flamingo is the most widespread and largest species of the flamingo family.","description":"<p>Greater flamingos are likely to be the only tall, pink bird in any given locale. </p><p>Greater flamingos have long, lean, curved necks and black-tipped bills with a distinctive downward bend.</p><p>Most of the plumage is pinkish-white, but the wing coverts are red and the primary and secondary flight feathers are black. </p><p>The bill is pink with a restricted black tip, and the legs are entirely pink. </p><p>Chicks are covered in gray fluffy down. Subadult flamingos are paler with dark legs. </p><p>Greater flamingos are capable flyers, and flamingos in captivity often require wing clipping to prevent escape. </p><p>Greater flamingos are found in a variety of saltwater habitats including salt or alkaline lakes, estuaries, shallow coastal lagoons and mudflats. </p><p>They rarely inhabits areas of freshwater other than using freshwater inlets for bathing and drinking. </p><p>Greater flamingo is an omnivore, filter-feeder. </p><p>It uses  its feet to stir up the mud, then sucks water through its bill and filters out small shrimp, seeds, blue-green algae as well as larva, small insects, and mollusks and crustaceans. </p><p>The greater flamingo feeds with its head down, and its upper jaw is movable and not rigidly fixed to its skull.</p><p>Their bills are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they eat. </p><p>The filtering of food items is assisted by hairy structures called lamellae, which line the mandibles, and the large, rough-surfaced tongue.</p><p>Greater flamingos are are monogamous, meaning pairs stay together for life. </p><p>They breed during April and May while gathered in groups on the extensive, warm, watery mudflats.</p><p>Greater flamingos build their nests in pairs. Nests are made out of hardened mud with a shallow depression in the top.</p><p>Like all species of flamingo, the female lays a single chalky-white egg. The mating pair take turns to incubate it. </p><p>The egg hatches after 27 to 31 days and the parents help the chick out of the egg by pulling pieces of the shell away.</p><p>Greater flamingos live and feed in groups called flocks or colonies. </p><p>They find safety in numbers, which helps to protect individual birds from predators while their heads are down in the mud. </p><p>The call is a goose-like honking.</p><p>Adult greater flamingos have few natural predators. </p><p>Eggs and chicks may be eaten by raptors, crows, gulls, and the marabou stork; an estimated half of the predation of greater flamingo eggs and chicks is from the yellow-legged gull.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/phoenicopterus-roseus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/phoenicopterus-roseus/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/phoenicopterus-roseus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/phoenicopterus-roseus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/phoenicopterus-roseus/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/phoenicopterus-roseus/featured.png","caption":"<p>Greater flamingos are capable flyers.</p><p>They fly with long neck and legs extended, when deep pink-and-black wing pattern is strikingly visible.</p>"},"icon":{"path":"atlas/phoenicopterus-roseus/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/phoenicopterus-roseus/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T10:51:43Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Phoenicopteriformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Phoenicopteridae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Phoenicopterus"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Phoenicopterus roseus"}],"aliases":[],"spreading":[{"name":"Africa","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Europe","area":"SOUTH","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Indian Subcontinent","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Middle East","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Greater flamingo call","samplePath":"atlas/phoenicopterus-roseus/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/phoenicopterus-roseus/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/phoenicopterus-roseus/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"wingspan","value":1.4,"maximum":1.65,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"1.4 to 1.65 m"},{"name":"height","value":1.1,"maximum":1.5,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Height","valueDisplay":"1.1 to 1.5 m"},{"name":"weight","value":2.0,"maximum":4.0,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"2 to 4 kg"},{"name":"lifespan","value":9.4670856E8,"maximum":1.26227808E9,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"30 to 40 years"},{"name":"lifespan.captivity","value":1.89341712E9,"maximum":null,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan in Captivity","valueDisplay":"60 years"},{"name":"speed.full","value":16.3889,"maximum":null,"quantity":"SPEED","nameDisplay":"Full Speed","valueDisplay":"59 km/h"}],"related":[{"index":55,"display":"White stork","definition":"The white stork is a large bird in the stork family Ciconiidae.
