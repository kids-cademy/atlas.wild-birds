{"index":29,"rank":0,"name":"dromaius-novaehollandiae","display":"Emu","definition":"A large, flightless Australian bird that has shaggy brown plumage and is raised for its meat, oil, and leather.","description":"<p>The emu is the second-largest living bird by height, after its ratite relative, the ostrich.</p><p>It is endemic to Australia where it is the largest native bird and the only extant member of the genus Dromaius.</p><p>Emus live in various habitats across Australia both inland and near the coast. They are most common in areas of savannah woodland and sclerophyll forest.</p><p>The emu is the second tallest bird in the world, only being exceeded in height by the ostrich.</p><p>The largest individuals can reach up to 190 centimeters in height. </p><p>Adult emus weigh between 18 and 60 kilograms, with an average of 31.5 and 37 kg in males and females, respectively.</p><p>Females are usually slightly larger than males and are substantially wider across the rump.</p><p>Although flightless, emus have vestigial wings, the wing chord measuring around 20 centimeters, and each wing having a small claw at the tip.</p><p>Emus flap their wings when running, perhaps as a means of stabilising themselves when moving fast.</p><p>They have long necks and legs, and can run at speeds of 48 kilometers per hour due to their highly specialised pelvic limb musculature.</p><p>Emus are diurnal birds and spend their day foraging, preening their plumage with their beak, dust bathing and resting.</p><p>They are generally gregarious birds apart from the breeding season, and while some forage, others remain vigilant to their mutual benefit.</p><p>They are able to swim when necessary, although they rarely do so unless the area is flooded or they need to cross a river.</p><p>Emus forage in a diurnal pattern and eat a variety of native and introduced plant species.</p><p>The diet depends on seasonal availability with such plants as acacia, casuarina and grasses being favoured.</p><p>They also eat insects and other arthropods, including grasshoppers and crickets, beetles, cockroaches, ladybirds, bogong and cotton-boll moth larvae, ants, spiders and millipedes.</p><p>Emus form breeding pairs during the summer months and may remain together for about five months.</p><p>Males construct a rough nest in a semi-sheltered hollow on the ground, using bark, grass, sticks and leaves to line it.</p><p>The nest is usually placed in an area where the emu has a clear view of its surroundings and can detect approaching predators.</p><p>Females are more aggressive than males during the courtship period, often fighting for access to mates.</p><p>There are few native natural predators of emus still alive. </p><p>The main predator of emus today is the dingo, which was originally introduced by Aboriginals thousands of years ago from a stock of semi-domesticated wolves.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/dromaius-novaehollandiae/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/dromaius-novaehollandiae/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/dromaius-novaehollandiae/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/dromaius-novaehollandiae/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/dromaius-novaehollandiae/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/dromaius-novaehollandiae/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T09:41:54Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Casuariiformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Dromaiidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Dromaius"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Dromaius
