{"index":52,"rank":0,"name":"anser-caerulescens","display":"Snow goose","definition":"A goose of North America and Siberia that has two color forms, one with white plumage and black wingtips and the other with bluish-gray plumage and a white head.","description":"<p>The snow goose has two color plumage morphs, white and gray-blue, thus the common names 'Snow' and 'Blue'.</p><p>Many taxonomic authorities placed this species and the other white geese in the genus Chen.</p><p>White-morph birds are white except for black wing tips, but blue-morph geese have bluish-grey plumage replacing the white except on the head, neck and tail tip. </p><p>The immature blue goose is drab or slate-gray with little to no white on the head, neck, or belly. </p><p>Both snow and blue geese have rose-red feet and legs, and pink bills with black cutting edges, giving them a black grin patch.</p><p>The colors are not as bright on the feet, legs, and bill of immature birds. </p><p>The head can be stained rusty-brown from minerals in the soil where they feed. </p><p>The snow goose breeds on sub arctic and arctic tundra, near ponds or streams and winters in coastal saltwater marshes and bays, wet grasslands, freshwater marshes, and fields and farmland.</p><p>They spend the colder seasons in southern coastal marshes, bays, wet grasslands, and fields.</p><p>Snow goose feeds in waterlogged soil or shallow waters, eating a variety of plant species, both aquatic and terestrial plants. </p><p>Some of their favorite foods include grasses and grains, sedges, willows, rushes, and horsetails. </p><p>Snow geese will eat all parts of a plant from seeds, leaves, and stems to tubers and roots.</p><p>Snow geese often nest in colonies. Nesting usually begins at the end of May or during the first few days of June.</p><p>The female selects a nest site and builds the nest on an area of high ground. </p><p>The nest is a shallow depression lined with plant material and may be reused from year to year. </p><p>After the female lays the first of three to five eggs, she lines the nest with down. </p><p>The female incubates for 22 to 25 days, and the young leave the nest within a few hours of hatching.</p><p>The young feed themselves, but are protected by both parents. </p><p>After 42 to 50 days they can fly, but they remain with their family until they are two to three years old. </p><p>Snow geese are messengers of the changing seasons. </p><p>They fly as far south as Texas and Mexico during winter, and return to nest on the Arctic tundra each spring.</p><p>They are very vocal and can often be heard from more than a mile away.</p><p>Major nest predators include Arctic foxes and skuas.</p><p>The biggest threat occurs during the first couple of weeks after the eggs are laid and then after hatching. </p><p>The eggs and young chicks are vulnerable to these predators, but adults are generally safe.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/anser-caerulescens/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/anser-caerulescens/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/anser-caerulescens/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/anser-caerulescens/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/anser-caerulescens/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/anser-caerulescens/featured.png","caption":"<p>This goose has two color morphs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>snow goose with white plumage and black wingtips,</li>\n<li>blue goose with bluish-gray plumage and a white head.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A single gene controls the color difference.</p>\n"},"icon":{"path":"atlas/anser-caerulescens/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/anser-caerulescens/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T13:47:34Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Anseriformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Anatidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Anser"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Anser caerulescens"}],"aliases":["Blue goose"],"spreading":[{"name":"North America","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Siberia","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Snow goose calls","samplePath":"atlas/anser-caerulescens/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/anser-caerulescens/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/anser-caerulescens/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"wingspan","value":1.35,"maximum":1.65,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"1.35 to 1.65 m"},{"name":"length","value":0.69,"maximum":0.84,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"69 to 84 cm"},{"name":"weight","value":1.59,"maximum":3.31,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"1.59 to 3.31 kg"},{"name":"lifespan","value":8.6781618E8,"maximum":null,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"27.5 years"},{"name":"speed.full","value":25.0,"maximum":null,"quantity":"SPEED","nameDisplay":"Full Speed","valueDisplay":"90 km/h"},{"name":"elevation","value":0.0,"maximum":2500.0,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Elevation","valueDisplay":"Up to 2.5 km"}],"related":[{"index":56,"display":"Whooper swan","definition":"A large white swan of Europe and Asia, having a loud whooping call.","iconPath":"atlas/cygnus-cygnus/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":44,"display":"Mallard","definition":"A wild duck found almost worldwide, the male of which has a green head and neck.
