{"index":14,"rank":0,"name":"spizella-passerina","display":"Chipping sparrow","definition":"The chipping sparrow  is a species of American sparrow, a passerine bird in the family Passerellidae.","description":"<p>It is widespread, fairly tame, and common across most of its North American range.</p><p>This bird is a partial migrant with northerly populations flying southwards in the fall to overwinter in Mexico.</p><p>Throughout the year, adults are gray below and an orangish-rust color above. </p><p>Adults in breeding plumage have a reddish cap, a nearly white supercilium, and a black trans-ocular line. </p><p>Adults in nonbreeding plumage are less prominently marked, with a brownish cap, a dusky eyebrow, and a dark eye-line.</p><p>The brownish cap and dusky eyebrow are variable but generally obscure in juveniles. </p><p>The chipping sparrow feeds on seeds year-round, although insects form most of the diet in the breeding season. </p><p>Common dandelion seeds are important during spring, but this sparrow diet includes seeds from black-bindweed, honey clover, chickweed, lamb's quarters, and common wild oat.</p><p>Spiders are sometimes taken. </p><p>Throughout the year, chipping sparrows forage on the ground in covered areas, often near the edges of fields.</p><p>The male chipping sparrow start arriving at the breeding grounds from March to mid-May. The female arrives one to two weeks later, and the male starts singing soon after to find and court a mate. </p><p>After pair formation, nesting begins - within about two weeks of the female's arrival. Overall, the breeding season is from March till about August.</p><p>Chipping sparrows have long been considered largely monogamous. However, polygyny and extra pair copulations are documented. </p><p>The chipping sparrow breeds in grassy, open woodland clearings and shrubby grass fields. </p><p>The nest is constructed by the female in about four days. </p><p>It consists of a loose platform of grass and rootlets and open inner cup of plant fiber and animal hair.</p><p>The nest is normally above ground but below 6 meters in height, in a tree - usually short and thick conifer, or a bush. </p><p>The chipping sparrow lays a clutch of two to seven pale blue to white eggs with black, brown, or purple markings. </p><p>Eggs are about 17 by 12 millimeters in size, and incubated by the female for 10 to 15 days.</p><p>This sparrow song is a trill that varies considerably among birds within any particular region. </p><p>Two broad classes of variation in the song of the chipping sparrow are the fast trill and the slow trill. </p><p>Individual elements in the fast trill are run together about twice as fast as in the slow trill; the fast trill sounds like a buzz or like someone snoring, whereas the slow trill sounds like rapid finger-tapping. </p><p>Individual elements in the trill are very similar to a high pitch chi chi chi call.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/spizella-passerina/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/spizella-passerina/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/spizella-passerina/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/spizella-passerina/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/spizella-passerina/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/spizella-passerina/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T03:13:16Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Passeriformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Emberizidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Spizella"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Spizella
