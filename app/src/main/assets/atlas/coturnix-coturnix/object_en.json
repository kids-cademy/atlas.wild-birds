They are omnivorous.</p><p>In general, common quails consume vegetative matter. Females require a high protein diet for breeding. </p><p>Weed seeds, cereal gleanings, and small insects and their larvae, including beetles, true bugs, ants, earwigs, and orthopterans are consumed. </p><p>Common quail breed once yearly and can have up to three clutches per season.</p><p>In Europe the breeding season is from mid-May to late August; in Africa, breeding occurs from September to March. </p><p>Common quail construct their nests in grass. </p><p>Common quail in Europe lay between 8 and 13 eggs per clutch. In Africa, a clutch consists of 6 to 12 eggs.</p><p>Eggs are pure white and approximately 2.5 centimeters in length. They weigh approximately 8.5 grams. Incubation time is 17 to 20 days.</p><p>The young quail are able to fly when they are eleven days old. </p><p>Rarely, if ever, does a quail die of old age. In fact, the average life span is less than 1 year. </p><p>Quail are a prey species and face major sources of mortality beginning the day it is laid in the nest as an egg. </p><p>On average, 70 percent to 80 percent of the nation's quail population is lost each year; this high mortality rate is off-set by large broods of wild quail.  </p><p>It should not be confused with the Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, native to Asia, which, although visually similar, has a very distinct call.</p><p>Like the Japanese quail, common quails are sometimes kept as poultry.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/coturnix-coturnix/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/coturnix-coturnix/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/coturnix-coturnix/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/coturnix-coturnix/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/coturnix-coturnix/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/coturnix-coturnix/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T08:18:13Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Galliformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Phasianidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Coturnix"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Coturnix coturnix"}],"aliases":["European quail"],"spreading":[{"name":"Europe","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Africa","area":"NORTH","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Asia","area":"WEST","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Common quail call","samplePath":"atlas/coturnix-coturnix/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/coturnix-coturnix/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/coturnix-coturnix/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"lifespan","value":3.1556952E7,"maximum":null,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"1 years"},{"name":"lifespan.record","value":4.607314992E8,"maximum":null,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan Record","valueDisplay":"14.6 years"},{"name":"length","value":0.18,"maximum":0.219,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"18 to 21.9 cm"},{"name":"wingspan","value":0.32,"maximum":0.35,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"32 to 35 cm"},{"name":"weight","value":0.091,"maximum":0.131,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"91 to 131 grams"},{"name":"speed","value":13.3333,"maximum":17.7778,"quantity":"SPEED","nameDisplay":"Speed","valueDisplay":"48 to 64 km/h"},{"name":"elevation","value":0.0,"maximum":1000.0,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Elevation","valueDisplay":"Up to 1 km"}],"related":[{"index":43,"display":"Indian peafowl","definition":"The Indian peafowl is a large and brightly coloured bird, is a species of peafowl native to the Indian subcontinent, but introduced in many other parts of the world.","iconPath":"atlas/pavo-cristatus/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":23,"display":"Common pheasant","definition":"The common pheasant is a bird in the pheasant family.
