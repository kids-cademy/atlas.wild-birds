{"index":39,"rank":0,"name":"dendrocopos-major","display":"Great spotted woodpecker","definition":"The great spotted woodpecker  is a medium-sized woodpecker with pied black and white plumage and a red patch on the lower belly.","description":"<p>The great spotted woodpecker is the most common and widespread of the British woodpeckers. </p><p>This species is found across Eurasia and parts of North Africa. Some individuals have a tendency to wander, leading to the recent recolonisation of Ireland and to vagrancy to North America.</p><p>It has black and white plumage, a prominent oval-shaped white patch on each wing, a red patch under the tail; males also have a red patch on the rear of the head. </p><p>There is a large white shoulder patch and the flight feathers are barred with black and white, as is the tail. </p><p>The bill is slate-black, the legs greenish-grey and the eye is deep red. </p><p>Juvenile birds are less glossy than adults and have a brown tinge to their upperparts and dirty white underparts. </p><p>The adult great spotted woodpecker is 20 to 24 centimeters long, weighs 70 to 98 grams and has a 34 to 39 centimeters wingspan.</p><p>The great spotted woodpecker is omnivorous. </p><p>It digs beetle larvae from trees and also takes many other invertebrates including adult beetles, ants and spiders. </p><p>Crustaceans, molluscs and carrion may be eaten, and bird feeders are visited for suet and domestic scraps.</p><p>The nests of other cavity-nesting birds, such as tits, may be raided for their eggs and chicks; nest boxes may be similarly attacked, holes being pecked to admit entrance by the woodpecker where necessary.</p><p>The great spotted woodpecker breeds in holes excavated in living or dead trees, unlined apart from wood chips.</p><p>The typical clutch is four to six glossy white eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs, feed the chicks and keep the nest clean.</p><p>When the young fledge they are fed by the adults for about ten days, each parent taking responsibility for feeding part of the brood.</p><p>Great spotted woodpeckers are strongly territorial, typically occupying areas of about 500 ha year-round, which are defended mainly by the male, a behaviour which attracts females. </p><p>Pairs are monogamous during the breeding period, but often change partners before the next season.</p><p>Adult great spotted woodpeckers have a complete moult after the breeding season which takes about 120 days.</p><p>The call of the great spotted woodpecker is a sharp kik, which may be repeated as a wooden rattling krrarraarr if the bird is disturbed. </p><p>The courtship call, gwig, is mostly given in the display flight. </p><p>The great spotted woodpecker drums on dead trees and branches, and sometimes suitable man-made structures, to maintain contact between paired adults and to advertise ownership of territory.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/dendrocopos-major/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/dendrocopos-major/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/dendrocopos-major/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/dendrocopos-major/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/dendrocopos-major/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/dendrocopos-major/featured.png","caption":"<p>Woodpeckers have zygodactil feet.
