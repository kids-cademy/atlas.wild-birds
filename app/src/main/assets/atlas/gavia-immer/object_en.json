{"index":19,"rank":0,"name":"gavia-immer","display":"Common loon","definition":"The common loon or great northern diver  is a large member of the loon, or diver, family of birds.","description":"<p>Breeding adults have a plumage that includes a broad black head and neck with a greenish, purplish, or bluish sheen.</p><p>They have blackish or blackish-grey upperparts, and pure white underparts.</p><p>Non-breeding adults are brownish with a dark neck and head marked with dark grey-brown.</p><p>Their upperparts are dark brownish-grey with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders, and the underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are whitish.</p><p>The sexes look alike, though males are significantly heavier than females.</p><p>A juvenile often has a dark, brownish-grey nape that may look darker than the pale-edged black feathers.</p><p>During the breeding season, loons live on lakes and other waterways in Canada, the northern United States, and southern parts of Greenland and Iceland.</p><p>Small numbers breed on Svalbard and sporadically elsewhere in Arctic Eurasia.</p><p>Common loons winter on both coasts of the US as far south as Mexico, and on the Atlantic coast of Europe.</p><p>Common loons eat a variety of animal prey including fish, crustaceans, insect larvae, molluscs, and occasionally aquatic plant life.</p><p>Fish account for about 80% of the diet of the common loon. It forages on fish of up to 26 centimeters in length.</p><p>They swallow most of their prey underwater, where it is caught, but some larger items are first brought to the surface.</p><p>Loons are monogamous; that is, a single female and male often together defend a territory and may breed together for a decade or more.</p><p>Both members of a pair build a large nest out of dead marsh grasses and other plants formed into a mound along the vegetated shores of lakes.</p><p>A single brood is raised each year from a clutch of one or two olive-brown oval eggs with dark brown spots which are incubated for about 28 days by both parents.</p><p>Fed by both parents, the chicks fledge in 70 to 77 days.</p><p>The chicks are capable of diving underwater when just a few days old, and they fly to their wintering areas before ice forms in the fall.</p><p>Their unusual cries, which vary from wails to tremolos to yodels, are distinct to individuals and can be heard at great distances.</p><p>Loon cries are most prevalent during breeding season as pairs aggressively defend their territories.</p><p>The United States Forest Service has designated the common loon a species of special status because of threats from habitat loss and toxic metal poisoning in its US range.</p><p>The common loon is the provincial bird of Ontario, and it appears on Canadian currency, including the one-dollar \"loonie\" coin and a previous series of $20 bills.</p><p>The common loon is assessed as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/gavia-immer/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/gavia-immer/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/gavia-immer/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/gavia-immer/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/gavia-immer/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/gavia-immer/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T08:06:10Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Gaviiformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Gaviidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Gavia"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Gavia immer"}],"aliases":["Great northern diver"],"spreading":[{"name":"Canada","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Both coasts of United States","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Atlantic cost of Europe","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Greenland","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Iceland","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Common loon call","samplePath":"atlas/gavia-immer/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/gavia-immer/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/gavia-immer/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"lifespan","value":0.0,"maximum":9.4670856E8,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"Up to 30 years"},{"name":"wingspan","value":1.27,"maximum":1.47,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"1.27 to 1.47 m"},{"name":"length","value":0.66,"maximum":0.91,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"66 to 91 cm"},{"name":"weight","value":2.95,"maximum":5.44,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"2.95 to 5.44 kg"},{"name":"elevation","value":0.0,"maximum":500.0,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Elevation","valueDisplay":"Up to 500 m"}],"related":[{"index":44,"display":"Mallard","definition":"A wild duck found almost worldwide, the male of which has a green head and neck.
