{"index":16,"rank":0,"name":"bucephala-clangula","display":"Common goldeneye","definition":"The common goldeneye  is a medium-sized sea duck of the genus Bucephala, the goldeneyes.","description":"<p>The species is named for its golden-yellow eye. </p><p>Adult males ranges from 45 to 51 centimeters long and weigh approximately one kilogram, while females range from 40 to 50 centimeters and weigh approximately 800 grams.</p><p>Adult males have a dark head with a greenish gloss and a circular white patch below the eye, a dark back and a white neck and belly. </p><p>Adult females have a brown head and a mostly grey body. </p><p>Their legs and feet are orange-yellow. </p><p>The Common Goldeneye breeds near freshwater lakes, pools and rivers surrounded by coniferous forests. </p><p>Outside the breeding season, it can be seen in coastal habitats including estuaries, salt bays, coastal lagoons and harbours. </p><p>It also frequents inland lakes and rivers remaining free of ice.</p><p>Common goldeneyes are diving birds that forage underwater. </p><p>Year-round, about 32% of their prey is crustaceans, 28% is aquatic insects and 10% is molluscs.</p><p>Insects are the predominant prey while nesting and crustaceans are the predominant prey during migration and winter.</p><p>Locally, fish eggs and aquatic plants can be important foods. </p><p>They themselves may fall prey to various hawks, owls and eagles, while females and their broods have been preyed upon by bears, various weasels, mink, raccoons and even northern flickers and red squirrels. </p><p>Common goldeneye breeding habitat is the taiga. They are found in the lakes and rivers of boreal forests. </p><p>They are migratory and most winter in protected coastal waters or open inland waters at more temperate latitudes.</p><p>Naturally, they nest in cavities in large trees, where they return year after year, though they will readily use nest boxes as well.</p><p>Average egg size is a breadth of 42 to 44 millimeters, a length of 58.1 to 60.6 millimeters and a weight of 61.2 to 66.6 grams.</p><p>The incubation period ranges from 28 to 32 days. </p><p>The female does all the incubating and is abandoned by the male about 1 to 2 weeks into incubation. </p><p>The young remain in the nest for about 24 to 36 hours.</p><p>The broods commonly start to mix with other females' broods as they become more independent or are abandoned by their mothers.</p><p>The Common Goldeneye is usually silent except during the courtship displays.</p><p>This beautiful duck is often seen in flocks and even in large concentrations, but usually of their own species.</p><p>Common goldeneyes are aggressive and territorial ducks, and have elaborate courtship displays.</p><p>Both the breeding and winter habitat of these birds has been degraded by clearance and pollution.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/bucephala-clangula/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/bucephala-clangula/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/bucephala-clangula/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/bucephala-clangula/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/bucephala-clangula/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/bucephala-clangula/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-25T03:05:08Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Anseriformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Anatidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Bucephala"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Bucephala clangula"}],"aliases":["Goldeneye"],"spreading":[{"name":"Eurasia","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Common goldeneye display calls","samplePath":"atlas/bucephala-clangula/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/bucephala-clangula/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/bucephala-clangula/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"lifespan","value":3.47126472E8,"maximum":3.78683424E8,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"11 to 12 years"},{"name":"length","value":0.4,"maximum":0.51,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"40 to 51 cm"},{"name":"wingspan","value":0.65,"maximum":0.8,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"65 to 80 cm"},{"name":"weight","value":0.8,"maximum":1.0,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"800 grams to 1 kg"}],"related":[{"index":44,"display":"Mallard","definition":"A wild duck found almost worldwide, the male of which has a green head and neck.
