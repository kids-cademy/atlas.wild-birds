{"index":57,"rank":0,"name":"meleagris-gallopavo","display":"Wild turkey","definition":"The wild turkey is an upland ground bird native to North America, one of two extant species of turkey, and the heaviest member of the diverse Galliformes.","description":"<p>It is the same species as the domestic turkey, which was originally derived from a southern Mexican subspecies of wild turkey.</p><p>The body feathers are generally blackish and dark, sometimes grey brown overall with a coppery sheen that becomes more complex in adult males. </p><p>Adult males, called toms or gobblers, have a large, featherless, reddish head, red throat, and red wattles on the throat and neck. </p><p>Adult wild turkeys have long reddish-yellow to grayish-green legs. </p><p>Juvenile males are called jakes; they have a very short beard and their tail fan has longer feathers in the middle.</p><p>Male turkeys have a long, dark, fan-shaped tail and glossy bronze wings. </p><p>As with many other species of the Galliformes, turkeys exhibit strong sexual dimorphism.  The male is substantially larger than the female.</p><p>The record-sized adult male wild turkey, according to the National Wild Turkey Federation, weighed 16.85 kilograms.</p><p>Wild turkeys prefer hardwood and mixed conifer-hardwood forests with scattered openings such as pastures, fields, orchards and seasonal marshes.</p><p>They seemingly can adapt to virtually any dense native plant community as long as coverage and openings are widely available.</p><p>Wild turkeys are omnivorous, foraging on the ground or climbing shrubs and small trees to feed. </p><p>They prefer eating acorns, nuts and other hard mast of various trees, including hazel, chestnut, hickory, and pinyon pine as well as various seeds, berries such as juniper and bearberry, roots and insects. </p><p>Turkeys also occasionally consume amphibians and small reptiles such as lizards and small snakes.</p><p>Males are polygamous, mating with as many hens as they can. </p><p>When mating is finished, females search for nest sites. Nests are shallow dirt depressions engulfed with woody vegetation. </p><p>Hens lay a clutch of 10 to 14 eggs, usually one per day. The eggs are incubated for at least 28 days. </p><p>The poults are precocial and nidifugous, leaving the nest in about 12 to 24 hours. </p><p>Despite their weight, wild turkeys, unlike their domesticated counterparts, are agile, fast fliers. </p><p>In ideal habitat of open woodland or wooded grasslands, they may fly beneath the canopy top and find perches. </p><p>Wild turkeys have very good eyesight, but their vision is very poor at night. They will not see a predator until it is too late.</p><p>Predators of eggs and nestlings include raccoons, opossums, striped skunks, gray foxes, groundhogs, other rodents and spotted skunks.</p><p>Predators of poults in addition to nestlings and eggs also include several species of snake, namely rat snakes, gopher snakes and pinesnakes.</p><p>Avian predators of poults include raptors such as bald eagles, barred owl, red-shouldered, red-tailed, white-tailed and Harris's hawks and even the smallish Cooper's hawk and broad-winged hawk.</p><p>Although native to North America, the turkey probably got its name from the domesticated variety being imported to Britain in ships coming from the Levant via Spain.</p><p>The British at the time therefore associated the wild turkey with the country Turkey and the name prevails.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/meleagris-gallopavo/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/meleagris-gallopavo/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/meleagris-gallopavo/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/meleagris-gallopavo/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/meleagris-gallopavo/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/meleagris-gallopavo/featured.png","caption":"<p>Unlike their domesticated counterpart, wild turkey are fast fliers.</p>\n<p>They usually fly close to the ground, for no more than 400 meters, but can reach 88 km/h.</p>\n"},"icon":{"path":"atlas/meleagris-gallopavo/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/meleagris-gallopavo/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T13:51:52Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Galliformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Phasianidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Meleagris"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Meleagris gallopavo"}],"aliases":["Common turkey"],"spreading":[{"name":"North America","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Wild turkey call","samplePath":"atlas/meleagris-gallopavo/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/meleagris-gallopavo/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/meleagris-gallopavo/waveform.png","facts":[{"name":"Color on the head reflects emotional state","value":"Color of the skin on the head and neck reflects emotional state of male.
