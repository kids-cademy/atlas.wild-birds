This is characteristic of herons and bitterns, and distinguishes them from storks, cranes, ibises, and spoonbills, which extend their necks in flight. </p><p>The great egret is partially migratory, with northern hemisphere birds moving south from areas with colder winters.</p><p>The great egret is a large heron with all-white plumage. </p><p>Standing up to one meter tall, this species can measure 80 to 104 centimeters in length and have a wingspan of 131 to 170 centimeters.</p><p>Body mass can range from 680 to 1,500 grams. It is thus only slightly smaller than the great blue or grey heron. </p><p>Apart from size, the great egret can be distinguished from other white egrets by its yellow bill and black legs and feet.</p><p>In breeding plumage, delicate ornamental feathers are borne on the back. </p><p>Males and females are identical in appearance; juveniles look like nonbreeding adults. </p><p>The great egret is generally a very successful species with a large and expanding range, occurring worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats.</p><p>Great egrets are found near water, salt or fresh, and feed in wetlands, streams, ponds, tidal flats, and other areas. </p><p>The great egret forages in shallow water or drier habitats.</p><p>It feeds mainly on fish, frogs, small mammals, and occasionally small reptiles and insects.</p><p>Most of the time, the great egret stands still, allowing the prey to come within its striking distance of its bill, which it uses as a spear. </p><p>It often waits motionless for prey, or slowly stalks its victim. </p><p>The species breeds in colonies in trees close to large lakes with reed beds or other extensive wetlands, preferably at height of 3 to 12.2 meters.</p><p>It begins to breed at 2 to 3 years of age by forming monogamous pairs each season. </p><p>If the pairing carries over to the next season is not known. </p><p>The male selects the nest area, starts a nest, and then attracts a female. </p><p>The nest, made of sticks and lined with plant material, could be up to 92 centimeters across. </p><p>Up to six bluish green eggs are laid at one time. </p><p>Both sexes incubate the eggs and the incubation period is 23 to 26 days. </p><p>The young are fed by regurgitation by both parents and they are able to fly within 6 to 7 weeks.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/ardea-alba/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ardea-alba/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/ardea-alba/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ardea-alba/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/ardea-alba/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ardea-alba/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T10:21:11Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Pelecaniformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Ardeidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Ardea"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Ardea alba"}],"aliases":["Common egret","Large egret","Great white egret","Great white heron"],"spreading":[],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Great egret calls","samplePath":"atlas/ardea-alba/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/ardea-alba/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ardea-alba/waveform.png","facts":[{"name":"Communicate via several calls","value":"Great egrets communicate via several calls.
