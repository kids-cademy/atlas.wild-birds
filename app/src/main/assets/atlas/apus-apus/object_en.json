{"index":27,"rank":0,"name":"apus-apus","display":"Common swift","definition":"The common swift  is a medium-sized bird, superficially similar to the barn swallow or house martin but somewhat larger.","description":"<p>Swifts have very short legs which they use primarily for clinging to vertical surfaces.</p><p>Common swifts are 16 to 17 centimeters long with a wingspan of 38 to 40 centimeters.</p><p>It is entirely blackish-brown except for a small white or pale grey patch on their chins, which is not visible from a distance.</p><p>They have a short forked tail and very long swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a boomerang.</p><p>The majority of the breeding habitat of common swift is located in temperate zones, where there are suitable trees for nesting and sufficient open spaces in which to fly to gather food. </p><p>The habitat of common swift during the months following migration into Africa, however, is tropical. </p><p>Common swifts have been observed breeding from sea level to several thousand meters in elevation. </p><p>They prefers areas with trees, or buildings with open spaces, and is able to use vertical surfaces such as rock walls and chimneys for nesting due to a unique physical adaptation possessed by all swifts.</p><p>Common swifts are insectivorous, feeding solely on aerial insects and spiders that it gathers in its mouth as it glides through the air. </p><p>The insects are gathered together inside the throat through the use of a product from the salivary glands, to form a food-ball or bolus. </p><p>Common swift is commonly attracted to swarms of insects, as it aides in the ease of collecting sufficient food. </p><p>It has been estimated that there are an average of 300 insects per bolus. </p><p>These numbers may vary based upon the abundance of prey. </p><p>Among some of the most commonly consumed insects are aphids, wasps, bees, and ants, beetles, and flies.</p><p>The common swift is a monogamous species, they are faithful to nesting sites each year and to mates during a breeding season.</p><p>The nest is typically composed of grass, leaves, hay, straw, and flower petals.</p><p>Female lays anywhere from one to four white eggs. </p><p>Eggs must then be dutifully incubated for 19 to 20 days while the embryos develop. </p><p>Both parents participate in the incubation of the clutch. </p><p>After the young hatch, it can take an additional 27 to 45 days before fledging occurs, usually more than 27 days.</p><p>Every July, young common swifts leave their European roosts and migrate to central and shouthern Africa. </p><p>They’ll only be back in the following June, and they’ll spend the intervening 10 months almost continuously in the air.</p><p>They never settle voluntarily on the ground, where they would be vulnerable to accidents and predation, and non-breeding individuals may spend up to ten months in continuous flight.</p><p>Most notable among the anti-predator adaptations of the common swift is its aerial mastery, allowing these birds to avoid most of their predators.</p><p>Natural enemies of the common swift includes Eurasian hobbies, sparrowhawks, and buzzards, that attack them on the air. </p><p>In addition, the choice of nesting sites on vertical surfaces makes it difficult for common swifts to be preyed upon, because of the level of difficulty associated with accessing the nest area.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/apus-apus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/apus-apus/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/apus-apus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/apus-apus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/apus-apus/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/apus-apus/featured.png","caption":"<p>Common swift -
