{"index":34,"rank":0,"name":"carduelis-carduelis","display":"European goldfinch","definition":"The European goldfinch is a small passerine bird in the finch family that is native to Europe, North Africa and western Asia.","description":"<p>European Goldfinch is one of the most colourful birds of our yards. Adult male has brown mantle and white rump. </p><p>The upperwing is black with bright yellow wing bar and white-tipped flight feathers. </p><p>Tail is black with white subterminal patches on external rectrices, and white-tipped median rectrices.</p><p>The underparts are white, with buff patches on breast sides and flanks.</p><p>On the head, face is bright red with black patches around the base of the bill. Head pattern is black and white.</p><p>Female is similar to male, but the red of the face does not extend behind the eyes. She has shorter bill too.</p><p>Fairly common in open woodland, parks, gardens, and farmland and open country with hedges and weedy patches.</p><p>In the winter goldfinches group together to form flocks of up to 40, occasionally more. </p><p>The goldfinch's preferred food is small seeds such as those from thistles and teasels, but insects are also taken when feeding young. </p><p>Goldfinch also regularly visits bird feeders, especially in the winter. </p><p>They are attracted by bird feeders containing niger seed. This seed of an annual from Africa is small, and high in oils. </p><p>Goldfinch breeds in mixed woodland, orchards, parks, commons, gardens and pine plantations where there are thistles and other plants that produce seeds. </p><p>The nest is built entirely by the female and is generally completed within a week. </p><p>The male accompanies the female, but does not contribute.</p><p>The nest is neat and compact and is generally located several meters above the ground, hidden by leaves in the twigs at the end of a swaying branch.</p><p>It is constructed of mosses and lichens and lined with plant down such as that from thistles. </p><p>It is attached to the twigs of the tree with spider silk. </p><p>A deep cup prevents the loss of eggs in windy weather.</p><p>Between four and six eggs are produced and these take up to 14 days to incubate. </p><p>Goldfinches are commonly kept and bred in captivity around the world because of their distinctive appearance and pleasant song. </p><p>If goldfinches are kept with canaries, they tend to lose their native song and call in favour of their cagemates' songs. </p><p>The song is a pleasant silvery twittering. </p><p>The call is a melodic tickeLIT, and the song is a pleasant tinkling medley of trills and twitters, but always including the tri-syllabic call phrase or a teLLIT-teLLIT-teLLIT.</p><p>European goldfinch has been introduced outside its native areas to other zones including Australia, New Zealand and Uruguay.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/carduelis-carduelis/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/carduelis-carduelis/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/carduelis-carduelis/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/carduelis-carduelis/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/carduelis-carduelis/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/carduelis-carduelis/featured.png","caption":"<p>The
