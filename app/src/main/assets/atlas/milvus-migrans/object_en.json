{"index":8,"rank":0,"name":"milvus-migrans","display":"Black kite","definition":"The black kite  is a medium-sized bird of prey in the family Accipitridae, which also includes many other diurnal raptors.","description":"<p>It is thought to be the world's most abundant species of Accipitridae, although some populations have experienced dramatic declines or fluctuations.</p><p>This kite is widely distributed through the temperate and tropical parts of Eurasia and parts of Australasia and Oceania, with the temperate region populations tending to be migratory.</p><p>Black kites can be distinguished from red kites by the slightly smaller size, less forked tail, and generally dark plumage without any rufous. </p><p>Males and females have the same plumage but females are longer than males. </p><p>The upper plumage is brown but the head and neck tend to be paler. The patch behind the eye appears darker. </p><p>The outer flight feathers are black and the feathers have dark cross bars and are mottled at the base. </p><p>The lower parts of the body are pale brown, becoming lighter towards the chin. </p><p>Black kites are most often seen gliding and soaring on thermals as they search for food. </p><p>They will swoop down with their legs lowered to snatch small live prey.</p><p>Large numbers may be seen soaring in thermals over cities. In some places, they will readily swoop and snatch food held by humans.</p><p>Black kites have broad, carnivorous diets and feed on many different animal species. </p><p>They are considered insectivores, piscivores, and scavengers. Black kites will hunt for food, but more often act as scavengers. </p><p>They will steal eggs from other kites for food and scavenge dead carcasses left behind from other animals. </p><p>Predation of nests of other pairs of black kites has also been noted.</p><p>Black kites also are known to hover over fires to catch insects. </p><p>Their diet also includes a variety of fish, reptiles, amphibians, bats, rodent and other small mammals and birds.</p><p>Black kites have well developed intraspecific communication, vocalizing very loudly and often with other black kites. </p><p>Their screech starts out as a long drawn \"kleee-errr\" sound, then transitions into a sharper \"keee-keee-keee\" call. </p><p>They communicate using high pitches for a variety of different situations, such as breeding, at roosting sites, or even during group hunting. </p><p>Black kites are believed to be monogamous, having a single mate at a time and may even pair for life, although there has been some debate. </p><p>Black kites have a ritualized aerial courtship, which consists of extremely loud calls to one another. </p><p>In addition, they perform a dangerous display known as grappling, where they lock their feet together in mid-air and begin to spiral towards the ground.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/milvus-migrans/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/milvus-migrans/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/milvus-migrans/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/milvus-migrans/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/milvus-migrans/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/milvus-migrans/featured.png","caption":"<p>Black
