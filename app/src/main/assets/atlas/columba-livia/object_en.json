{"index":50,"rank":0,"name":"columba-livia","display":"Rock dove","definition":"A common dove from which domestic and feral pigeons are descended. It has a pale grey plumage with black-striped wings.","description":"<p>The rock dove is a member of the bird family Columbidae. In common usage, this bird is often simply referred to as the pigeon.</p><p>The domestic pigeon, Columba livia domestica - which includes about a thousand different breeds, descended from this species.</p><p>Escaped domestic pigeons have raised the populations of feral pigeons around the world.</p><p>The rock dove has a dark bluish-grey head, neck, and chest with glossy yellowish, greenish, and reddish-purple iridescence along its neck and wing feathers. </p><p>The iris is orange, red, or golden with a paler inner ring, and the bare skin round the eye is bluish-grey. </p><p>The bill is grey-black with a conspicuous off-white cere, and the feet are purplish-red. </p><p>The adult female is almost identical in outward appearance to the male, but the iridescence on her neck is less intense, and that on the breast is often very obscure.</p><p>Rock doves feed in the early morning and in the mid-afternoon on the open ground. </p><p>They feed in flocks or individually and eat mainly seeds. </p><p>Studies in semi-rural areas found that their diet includes the following: 92% corn, 3.2% oats, 3.7% cherry, along with small amounts of knotweed, elm, poison ivy, and barley. </p><p>In cities, feral pigeons also eat popcorn, cake, peanuts, bread, and currants. </p><p>Female rock doves need to eat a diet somewhat higher in protein and calcium in order to have the nutritional resources to lay eggs.</p><p>The rock dove breeds at any time of the year, but peak times are spring and summer.  The species is generally monogamous.</p><p>Nesting sites are along coastal cliff faces, as well as the artificial cliff faces created by apartment buildings with accessible ledges or roof spaces.</p><p>The nest is a flimsy platform of straw and sticks, laid on a ledge, under cover, often on the window ledges of buildings.</p><p>Two white eggs are laid; incubation, shared by both parents, lasts 17 to 19 days. Both parents care for the young for a time.</p><p>Pigeons, especially homing or carrier breeds, are well known for their ability to find their way home from long distances. </p><p>Despite these demonstrated abilities, wild rock doves are sedentary and rarely leave their local areas.</p><p>With only their flying abilities protecting them from predation, rock doves are a favourite for a wide range of raptors.</p><p>Peregrine falcons and Eurasian sparrowhawks are natural predators of this doves.</p><p>Originally found wild in Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, pigeons have become established in cities around the world.</p><p>The species is abundant, with an estimated population of 17 to 28 million feral and wild birds in Europe alone.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/columba-livia/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/columba-livia/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/columba-livia/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/columba-livia/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/columba-livia/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/columba-livia/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T13:45:17Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Columbiformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Columbidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Columba"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Columba livia"}],"aliases":["Rock pigeon","Common pigeon","Pigeon"],"spreading":[{"name":"Europe","area":"SOUTH","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Africa","area":"NORTH","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Asia","area":"SOUTH","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Rock dove song","samplePath":"atlas/columba-livia/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/columba-livia/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/columba-livia/waveform.png","facts":[{"name":"Pigeons are used for racing","value":"Because of their incredible speed and endurance, pigeons are used for racing.
