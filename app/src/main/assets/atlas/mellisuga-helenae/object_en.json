{"index":7,"rank":0,"name":"mellisuga-helenae","display":"Bee hummingbird","definition":"The bee hummingbird is a species of hummingbird which is the world's smallest bird.","description":"<p>The bee hummingbird is endemic to the entire Cuban archipelago, including the main island of Cuba and the Isla de la Juventud in the West Indies.</p><p>The bee hummingbird is the smallest living bird and ranks with the pygmy shrews as the smallest of warm-blooded vertebrates.</p><p>Females weigh 2.6 g and are 6.1 cm long, and are slightly larger than males, with an average weight of 1.95 g and length of 5.5 cm.</p><p>As its name suggests, it is scarcely larger than a bee.</p><p>Like all hummingbirds, it is a swift, strong flier. </p><p>The male has a green pileum and bright red throat, iridescent gorget with elongated lateral plumes, bluish upper parts, and the rest of the underparts mostly greyish white.</p><p>The female is green above, whitish below, with white tips to the outer tail feathers.</p><p>During the mating season, males have a reddish to pink head, chin, and throat.</p><p>Compared to other small hummingbirds, which often have a slender appearance, the bee hummingbird looks rounded and plump.</p><p>Though these hummingbirds appear to live at both low and high altitudes, they seem to favor lowland locations. </p><p>They are spread throughout the interior and coastal forests, swampy areas, mountain valleys, and also in the manmade gardens, especially those that have feeders.</p><p>The bee hummingbird feeds mainly on nectar, and an occasional insect or spider, by moving its tongue rapidly in and out of its mouth.</p><p>The bird's slender, pointed bill is adapted for probing deep into flowers.</p><p>In a typical day, bee hummingbirds will consume up to half their body weight in food and will help pollinate up to 1,500 flowers.</p><p>Bee hummingbirds are polygamous. They can have multiple partners during mating season.</p><p>Before laying the eggs, female bee hummingbirds build an extremely tiny nest that shapes like a cup. </p><p>The nest is made of thin twigs that are held together by lichens and cobwebs.</p><p>The female lays only two eggs at a time, each about the size of a coffee bean.</p><p>The gestation period is about 22 days during which time, the eggs are incubated by the female bird. </p><p>The nestlings are also fed and cared for only by the female bird.</p><p>Male bee hummingbirds are territorial and will aggressively chase other nectar-feeding animals, including birds, moths and bees, from feeding territories.</p><p>In the process of feeding, the bird picks up pollen on its bill and head. When it flies from flower to flower, it transfers the pollen. </p><p>In this way, it plays an important role in plant reproduction.</p><p>The primary enemies of the bee hummingbirds are other larger birds including hawks, falcons, kestrels, orioles, as well as frogs, different kinds of fishes, and tropical spiders.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/mellisuga-helenae/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/mellisuga-helenae/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/mellisuga-helenae/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/mellisuga-helenae/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/mellisuga-helenae/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/mellisuga-helenae/featured.png","caption":"<p>Bee
