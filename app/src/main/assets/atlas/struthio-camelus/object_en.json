Females and young males are grayish-brown and white. </p><p>The head and neck of both male and female ostriches is nearly bare, with a thin layer of down.</p><p>The skin of the female's neck and thighs is pinkish gray, while the male's is gray or pink dependent on subspecies.</p><p>Common ostrich eyes are said to be the largest of any land vertebrate: 50 mm in diameter; helping them to see predators at a great distance. </p><p>However, the head and bill are relatively small for the birds' huge size, with the bill measuring 12 to 14.3 cm.</p><p>Common ostrich mainly feed on seeds, shrubs, grass, fruit and flowers; occasionally they also eat insects such as locusts.</p><p>Lacking teeth, they swallow pebbles that act as gastroliths to grind food in the gizzard. </p><p>When eating, they will fill their gullet with food, which is in turn passed down their esophagus in the form of a ball called a bolus. </p><p>After passing through the neck the food enters the gizzard and is worked on by the aforementioned pebbles. </p><p>The gizzard can hold as much as 1,300 g, of which up to 45% may be sand and pebbles.</p><p>Common ostriches can go without drinking for several days, using metabolic water and moisture in ingested plants, but they enjoy liquid water and frequently take baths where it is available.</p><p>They can survive losing up to 25% of their body weight through dehydration.</p><p>Common ostriches become sexually mature when they are 2 to 4 years old; females mature about six months earlier than males. </p><p>As with other birds, an individual may reproduce several times over its lifetime. </p><p>The mating process differs in different geographical regions. </p><p>Territorial males typically boom in defense of their territory and harem of two to seven hens.</p><p>The successful male may then mate with several females in the area, but will only form a pair bond with a 'major' female.</p><p>As a flightless species in the rich biozone of the African savanna, the common ostrich must face a variety of formidable predators throughout its life cycle. </p><p>Animals that prey on ostriches of all ages may include cheetahs, lions, leopards, African hunting dogs, and spotted hyenas.</p><p>Predators of nests and young common ostriches include jackals, various birds of prey, warthogs, mongoose and Egyptian vultures.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/struthio-camelus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/struthio-camelus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/struthio-camelus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/struthio-camelus/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/struthio-camelus/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/struthio-camelus/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T08:12:31Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Struthioniformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Struthionidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Struthio"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Struthio camelus"}],"aliases":["Ostrich"],"spreading":[{"name":"Africa","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":{"value":15.0,"mask":132102},"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Common ostrich call.","samplePath":"atlas/struthio-camelus/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/struthio-camelus/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/struthio-camelus/waveform.png","facts":[{"name":"The fastest running bird","value":"Ostriches are the fastest running bird.
