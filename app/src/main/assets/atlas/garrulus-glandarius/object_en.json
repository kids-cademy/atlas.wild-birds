{"index":31,"rank":0,"name":"garrulus-glandarius","display":"Eurasian jay","definition":"Eurasian jay is one of the most colorful members of the Corvidae family and is instantly recognizable because of its distinct markings.","description":"<p>The Eurasian jay is spread over a vast region from Western Europe and north-west Africa to the Indian Subcontinent and further to the eastern seaboard of Asia and down into south-east Asia.</p><p>The plumage of the Eurasian jay is mainly light reddish brown. Their feathers reflect UV light.</p><p>Both adult birds are similar, with pinkish-grey to reddish-brown upperparts. </p><p>They have a black mustache, and black-and-white wing pattern, with a patch of blue on the shoulder. Also, they have white rump, usually obvious in flight. </p><p>The strong beak is blackish with whitish bristles. Eyes are bluish-white. Legs and feet are pinkish-brown.</p><p>The juvenile birds are similar to adults, but with darker body plumage, greyer beak, more bluish eyes and brighter legs.</p><p>Eurasian jays prefer dense foliage, with plenty of trees, bushes, and undergrowth. </p><p>Trees are essential due to their arboreal lifestyles, though they also forage on the ground. </p><p>High levels of biodiversity are important so they can enjoy varied diets. </p><p>Deciduous oak forests are preferred for foraging, but coniferous forests provide the best nesting places. </p><p>Eurasian jays do not like open areas and will avoid entering them if possible. </p><p>Eurasian jay is omnivorous and feeds also in trees and on the ground. It consumes a wide range of invertebrates, including many pest insects.</p><p>Its diet also includes acorns, beechnuts and other seeds, fruits such as blackberries and rowan berries, young birds, and eggs, bats, and small rodents. </p><p>Like most species, the jay' diet changes with the seasons but is noteworthy for its prolific storing of food - especially oak acorns and beechnuts, which it buries, for the use during winter and spring. </p><p>While food storing occurs throughout the year, it is most intense in the autumn.</p><p>It nests in trees or large shrubs laying usually 4 to 6 eggs that hatch after 16 to 19 days and are fledged generally after 21 to 23 days. </p><p>Both sexes typically feed the young. </p><p>Eurasian jays are solitary birds but can be found in pairs during the breeding season and often form small flocks for foraging in the fall and winter.</p><p>They are shy and will spook easily, but their slow, jerky flight with an undulating path is easy to recognize.</p><p>In order to keep its plumage free from parasites, Eurasian jay lies on top of anthills with spread wings and lets its feathers be sprayed with formic acid.</p><p>They are fairly intelligent, and may even play games or engage in other unique behaviors.</p><p>Male Eurasian jays also take into account the desires of their partner when sharing food with her, as a courtship ritual.</p><p>Wide vocal repertoire: typical call a dry “scaaaaak,” as well as varied warbling and hooted notes.</p><p>Its usual call is the alarm call which is a harsh, rasping screech and is used upon sighting various predatory animals.</p><p>Anyway, jay is well known for its mimicry, often sounding so like a different species that it is virtually impossible to distinguish its true identity unless the jay is seen.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/garrulus-glandarius/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/garrulus-glandarius/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/garrulus-glandarius/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/garrulus-glandarius/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/garrulus-glandarius/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/garrulus-glandarius/featured.png","caption":"<p>Similar to other corvids, Eurasian jays have been reported to plan for future needs.</p><p>It stores food - especially oak acorns and beechnuts, which it buries, for the use during winter and spring.</p>"},"icon":{"path":"atlas/garrulus-glandarius/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/garrulus-glandarius/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T09:52:46Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Passeriformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Corvidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Garrulus"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Garrulus glandarius"}],"aliases":["Jay"],"spreading":[{"name":"Africa","area":"NORTH_WEST","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Europe","area":"WEST","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Indian Subcontinent","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Eurasian jay call","samplePath":"atlas/garrulus-glandarius/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/garrulus-glandarius/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/garrulus-glandarius/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"lifespan","value":9.4670856E7,"maximum":1.5778476E8,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"3 to 5 years"},{"name":"length","value":0.32,"maximum":0.35,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"32 to 35 cm"},{"name":"weight","value":0.14,"maximum":0.185,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"140 to 185 grams"},{"name":"wingspan","value":0.54,"maximum":0.58,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"54 to 58 cm"},{"name":"elevation","value":0.0,"maximum":4000.0,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Elevation","valueDisplay":"Up to 4 km"}],"related":[{"index":25,"display":"Common raven","definition":"The common raven is a large all-black passerine bird.
