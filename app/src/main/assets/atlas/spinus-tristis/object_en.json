{"index":0,"rank":0,"name":"spinus-tristis","display":"American goldfinch","definition":"The American goldfinch is a small North American bird in the finch family.","description":"<p>American goldfinch is migratory, ranging from mid-Alberta to North Carolina during the breeding season.</p><p>During winter, its range is  from south of the Canada–United States border to Mexico.</p><p>The American goldfinch prefers open country where weeds thrive, such as fields, meadows, flood plains, as well as roadsides, orchards, and gardens. </p><p>It may also be found in open deciduous and riparian woodlands and areas of secondary growth.</p><p>Adult males in spring and summer are bright yellow with black forehead and wings. </p><p>Females are dull yellow below and olive above with two distinct wingbars. </p><p>In winter, both sexes are drab, buffy-brown. </p><p>The immature American goldfinch has a dull brown back, and the underside is pale yellow. </p><p>The American goldfinch is a small finch, 11 to 14 centimeters long, with a wingspan of 19 to 22 centimeters. It weighs between 11 and 20 grams.</p><p>The beak is small, conical, and pink for most of the year, but turns bright orange with the spring molt in both sexes.</p><p>The shape and size of the beak aid in the extraction of seeds from the seed heads of thistles, sunflowers, and other plants.</p><p>The American goldfinch is a diurnal feeder. </p><p>According to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the species is one of the strictest vegetarians in the bird world.</p><p>It is mainly granivorous, but will occasionally eat insects, which are also fed to its young to provide protein. </p><p>Its diet consists of the seeds from a wide variety of annual plants, often those of weeds, grasses, and trees.</p><p>It eats seeds from thistle, teasel, dandelion, ragweed, mullein, cosmos, goatsbeard, sunflower, and alder.</p><p>However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, and berries. </p><p>It will eat at bird feeders provided by humans, particularly in the winter months, preferring Niger seed.</p><p>During the breeding season, this finch lives in loose colonies. </p><p>This species is generally monogamous, and produces one brood each year.</p><p>While the nest is being constructed, both male and female will act aggressively toward other intruders, driving them away.</p><p>The American goldfinch flies in a distinctive undulating pattern, creating a wave-shaped path. </p><p>This normally consists of a series of wing beats to lift the bird, then folding in the wings and gliding in an arc before repeating the pattern. </p><p>Birds often vocalize during the flapping phase of the pattern and then go silent during the coasting phase. </p><p>The call made during flight is \"per-twee-twee-twee\", or \"ti-di-di-di\", punctuated by the silent periods.</p><p>Predators include snakes, weasels, squirrels, and blue jays, which may destroy eggs or kill young, and hawks and cats, which pose a threat to both young and adults.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/spinus-tristis/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/spinus-tristis/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/spinus-tristis/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/spinus-tristis/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/spinus-tristis/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/spinus-tristis/featured.png","caption":"<p>Human
