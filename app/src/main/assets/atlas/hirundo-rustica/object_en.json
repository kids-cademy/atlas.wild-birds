{"index":6,"rank":0,"name":"hirundo-rustica","display":"Barn swallow","definition":"A widely distributed bird that nests in barns and caves and has a deeply forked tail, a dark-blue back, and tan underparts.","description":"<p>The barn swallow  is the most widespread species of swallow in the world. </p><p>Barn swallows are small birds. They are 14.6 to 19.9 centimeters long and have a wingspan of 31.8 to 34.3 centimeters. </p><p>Barn swallows are metallic blue-black above and pale beige below. </p><p>They have light brown on their throat and forehead, and have a long, deeply-forked tail. </p><p>Males and females look very similar. However, females tend to be less brightly colored and have shorter tails.</p><p>Barn swallows are very adaptable birds. </p><p>They can nest anywhere where there are open areas for foraging, a water source, and a sheltered ledge for their nest. </p><p>They seek out open habitats of all types, including farms, and are commonly found in barns or other outbuildings. </p><p>They also build nests under bridges, the eaves of old houses, and boat docks, as well as in rock caves and even on slow-moving trains.</p><p>While migrating, barn swallows tend to fly over open habitats, often near water or along mountain ridges. </p><p>Barn swallows generally nest below 3000 meters elevation. </p><p>Barn swallows are insectivores. </p><p>Flies, grasshoppers, crickets, dragonflies, beetles, moths and other flying insects make up 99 % of their diet. </p><p>They catch most of their prey while in flight, and are able to feed their young at the nest while flying.</p><p>Barn swallows forage opportunistically. </p><p>They have been observed following tractors and plows, catching the insects that are disturbed by the machinery. </p><p>Barn swallows usually breed between May and August. </p><p>The male and female work together to build a nest. </p><p>The nest is built of a mud shell, and is lined with grass and feathers. </p><p>The female lays 3 to 7 eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs, which hatch in 13 to 15 days. </p><p>The chicks are naked and helpless when they hatch.  Both parents feed and protect the chicks.</p><p>Kestrels and other hawks, owls, gulls, grackles, rats, squirrels, weasels, raccoons, bobcats, domestic cats, snakes, bullfrogs, fish and fire ants are predators of barn swallows. </p><p>Barn swallows usually give alarm calls when predators come near. </p><p>Most predators of barn swallows attack the nestlings, but hawks, falcons, and owls tend to hunt adults.</p><p>Barn swallows mainly escape predators by being swift and agile in flight and by building their nests in places that are difficult for predators to reach.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/hirundo-rustica/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/hirundo-rustica/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/hirundo-rustica/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/hirundo-rustica/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/hirundo-rustica/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/hirundo-rustica/featured.png","caption":"<p>Thirsty barn swallow flies close to the surface of water and scoops water using its beak during the flight.</p>"},"icon":{"path":"atlas/hirundo-rustica/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/hirundo-rustica/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T01:20:47Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Passeriformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Hirundinidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Hirundo"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Hirundo rustica"}],"aliases":["House swallow","Swallow"],"spreading":[],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Barm swallow song and calls","samplePath":"atlas/hirundo-rustica/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/hirundo-rustica/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/hirundo-rustica/waveform.png","facts":[{"name":"Eat different types of large insects","value":"Barn swallows eat different types of large insects.
