Is spread across Europe and Asia but it spends winter in dry savannas of sub-Saharan Africa. </p><p>The common nightingale is slightly larger than the European robin, at 15 to 16.5 centimeters length. </p><p>It is plain brown above except for the reddish tail. It is buff to white below. </p><p>Flight feathers are washed rufous according to the light. Sexes are similar. </p><p>The eastern subspecies have paler upperparts and a stronger face-pattern, including a pale supercilium. </p><p>The Common nightingale frequents open woodland with thickets and dense patches of vegetation along water bodies, and edges of deciduous woodland and pine forest, and borders of dry areas such as garrigue and maquis.</p><p>It can be found in cultivated areas with hedgerows and bushes, in suburban gardens and parks with leaf litter.</p><p>This species usually occurs below 500 meters, but according to the range, it may be found to higher elevation.</p><p>The Common nightingale feeds on invertebrates such as beetles, ants, caterpillars, flies, spiders and earthworms. </p><p>Since it also takes seeds and berries, especially in autumn, Common nightingale is classified as omnivorous.    </p><p>The breeding season varies according to the range, but occurs between late April and mid-July throughout Europe.</p><p>This species usually produces two broods.</p><p>The Common nightingale’s nest is often placed near the ground, below 50 centimeters, very well camouflaged among the leaf litter, at base of tussock or low grass. </p><p>This is an open cup, a bulky structure made with dead leaves and grass. The inner part is lined with finer grasses, feathers and hair.</p><p>The female lays 4 to 5 olive-green eggs. Incubation lasts 13 to 14 days, by female fed by male during this period. </p><p>The nesting period lasts about 10 to 12 days, then, the young birds disperse into the cover in the vicinity of the nest. </p><p>They can fly 3 to 5 days later. They are fed and cared by both adults for 2 to 4 weeks more. </p><p>The male often cares them while the female starts a second clutch.</p><p>One of the most notable characteristics of common nightingales is their beautiful singing ability, especially by male birds. </p><p>They are well known for singing during the night, hence their name.</p><p>The song of the nightingale has been described as one of the most beautiful sounds in nature, inspiring songs, fairy tales, opera, books, and a great deal of poetry.</p><p>Common nightingale is solitary bird outside the breeding
