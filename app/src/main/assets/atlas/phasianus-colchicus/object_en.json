{"index":23,"rank":0,"name":"phasianus-colchicus","display":"Common pheasant","definition":"The common pheasant is a bird in the pheasant family. The genus name comes from Latin phasianus.","description":"<p>The species name colchicus is Latin for \"of Colchis\", an historical country on the Black Sea where pheasants became known to Europeans.</p><p>It is native to Asia and has been widely introduced elsewhere as a game bird.</p><p>The adult male is 60 to 89 centimeters in length with a long brown streaked black tail, accounting for almost 50 centimeters of the total length. </p><p>The body plumage is barred bright gold or fiery copper-red and chestnut-brown plumage with iridescent sheen of green and purple. </p><p>The wing coverage is white or cream and black-barred markings are common on the tail.</p><p>The head is bottle green with a small crest and distinctive red wattle. Behind the face are two ear-tufts, that make the pheasant more alert.</p><p>The female (hen) is much less showy, with a duller mottled brown plumage all over and measuring 50 to 63  centimeters long, including a tail of around 20 centimeters. </p><p>Juvenile birds have the appearance of the female with a shorter tail until young males begin to grow characteristic bright feathers on the breast, head and back at about 10 weeks after hatching.</p><p>Common pheasant frequents farmlands, open lands with shrubby cover, woodland edges, open woodlands, from lowlands to mountain foothills.</p><p>Common pheasant feeds on cereal grains, seeds, buds, leaves, fruits and some invertebrates.</p><p>The nesting period occurs from March to August, with a peak in April-June.</p><p>Common Pheasant’s nest is a shallow scratched-out depression of twigs, grass and rootlets. </p><p>It is lined with grass or leaves, and usually well hidden into vegetation, giving it domed appearance.</p><p>Female lays about 8 to 14 olive-brown eggs. Incubation lasts about 22 to 25 days, by female alone. </p><p>Chicks are precocial, and leave the nest immediately. </p><p>They are able to perform short flights at 12 to 14 days of age, but they are dependent on insect food in the first two weeks after hatching. They fledge at about 8 to 11 weeks.</p><p>This species produces one brood per season.</p><p>These birds are most comfortable on the ground, where they forage for food.</p><p>While pheasants are able short-distance fliers, they prefer to run. </p><p>If startled they can suddenly burst upwards at great speed, with a distinctive \"whirring\" wing sound. </p><p>Their flight speed is only 40 to 60 kilometers per hour when cruising but when chased they can fly up to 96 kilometers per hour.</p><p>In autumn, common pheasants form flocks in which they will live until the following spring.</p><p>Most all pheasants succumb to mortality due to predation rather than old age or disease. </p><p>In fact, the average lifespan for a wild pheasant is only one year. </p><p>In each stage of its life, the pheasant will lose half of the remaining brood size from predation.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/phasianus-colchicus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/phasianus-colchicus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/phasianus-colchicus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/phasianus-colchicus/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/phasianus-colchicus/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/phasianus-colchicus/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T08:14:41Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Galliformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Phasianidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Phasianus"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Phasianus
