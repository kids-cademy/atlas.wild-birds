It has a long thin neck, which it usually holds erect. Their webbed feet and their legs are black. </p><p>Half the beak at the base is orangey-yellow and the tip is black. </p><p>The markings on the beak differ between individuals and they can be recognized by means of the pattern. </p><p>Juveniles are usually white but some are gray.</p><p>Whooper swan is considered to be amongst the heaviest flying birds. </p><p>The verified record mass was 15.5 kilograms for a wintering male from Denmark. </p><p>Like their close relatives, whooper swans are vocal birds with a call similar to the trumpeter swan. </p><p>Whooper swans require large areas of water to live in, especially when they are still growing.</p><p>This is because their body weight cannot be supported by their legs for extended periods of time. </p><p>Their preferred breeding habitat is wetland, but semi-domesticated birds will build a nest anywhere close to water. </p><p>They favor habitats with emergent vegetation, and this may offer additional protection for their nests and the newborn cygnets.</p><p>A whooper swan feeds in shallow water and eats aquatic plants and roots. </p><p>The young eat small insects and a variety of invertebrates to satisfy their high protein needs for growth and development. </p><p>Whooper swans will often feed on fields, eating crops like leftover potatoes and grain, before heading to roost on open water.</p><p>Whooper swans breed in subarctic Eurasia.</p><p>They pair for life, and their cygnets stay with them all winter; they are sometimes joined by offspring from previous years. </p><p>Both the male and female help build the nest, and the male will stand guard over the nest while the female incubates. </p><p>The female will usually lay 4 to 7 eggs. </p><p>The cygnets hatch after about 36 days and have a grey or brown plumage. </p><p>The cygnets can fly at an age of 120 to 150 days. </p><p>The whooper swan spends much of its time swimming, straining the water for food, or eating plants that grow on the bottom.</p><p>Whooper swans have a deep honking call and, despite their size, are powerful fliers. </p><p>They can migrate hundreds or even thousands of miles to their wintering sites in southern Europe and eastern Asia. </p><p>New born cygnets are mainly lost to herons, turtles, pike and large perch. </p><p>Adults do not have many predators due to their habitat condition.</p><p>Whooper swans are much admired in Europe.</p><p>The whooper swan is the national bird of Finland and is featured on the Finnish 1 euro coin.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/cygnus-cygnus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/cygnus-cygnus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/cygnus-cygnus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/cygnus-cygnus/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/cygnus-cygnus/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/cygnus-cygnus/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-24T17:48:11Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Anseriformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Anatidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Cygnus"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Cygnus cygnus"}],"aliases":["Common swan"],"spreading":[{"name":"Europe","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Asia","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Whooper swan call","samplePath":"atlas/cygnus-cygnus/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/cygnus-cygnus/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/cygnus-cygnus/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"lifespan","value":6.3113904E8,"maximum":7.889238E8,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"20 to 25 years"},{"name":"length","value":1.4,"maximum":1.65,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"1.4 to 1.65 m"},{"name":"wingspan","value":2.05,"maximum":2.75,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"2.05 to 2.75 m"},{"name":"weight","value":7.4,"maximum":14.0,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"7.4 to 14 kg"},{"name":"speed.full","value":38.8889,"maximum":null,"quantity":"SPEED","nameDisplay":"Full Speed","valueDisplay":"140 km/h"},{"name":"length.bill","value":0.092,"maximum":0.116,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Bill Length","valueDisplay":"9.2 to 11.6 cm"}],"related":[{"index":44,"display":"Mallard","definition":"A wild duck found almost worldwide, the male of which has a green head and neck.
