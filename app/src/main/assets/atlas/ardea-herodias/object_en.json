{"index":37,"rank":0,"name":"ardea-herodias","display":"Great blue heron","definition":"The great blue heron is a large wading bird in the heron family Ardeidae, common near the shores of open water and in weatlands.","description":"<p>The great blue heron is spread over most of North America and Central America, as well as the Caribbean and the Galápagos Islands.</p><p>It is the largest North American heron. </p><p>Notable features of great blue herons include slaty flight feathers, red-brown thighs, and a paired red-brown and black stripe up the flanks.</p><p>The neck is rusty-gray, with black and white streaking down the front.</p><p>The head is paler, with a nearly white face, and a pair of black or slate plumes runs from just above the eye to the back of the head. </p><p>The bill is dull yellowish and the lower legs are gray.</p><p>The great blue heron can adapt to almost any wetland habitat in its range. </p><p>It may be found in numbers in fresh and saltwater marshes, mangrove swamps, flooded meadows, lake edges, or shorelines. </p><p>It is quite adaptable and may be seen in heavily developed areas as long as they hold bodies of fish-bearing water. </p><p>Great blue herons rarely venture far from bodies of water, but are occasionally seen flying over upland areas.</p><p>The primary food for great blue heron is small fish.</p><p>It is also known to opportunistically feed on a wide range of shrimp, crabs, aquatic insects, rodents, and other small mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and birds, especially ducklings. </p><p>Herons locate their food by sight and usually swallow it whole. They have been known to choke on prey that is too large.</p><p>It is generally a solitary feeder.</p><p>This species usually breeds in colonies, in trees close to lakes or other wetlands. These groups are called a heronry.</p><p>Although nests are often reused for many years and herons are socially monogamous within a single breeding season, individuals usually choose new mates each year.</p><p>Great blue herons build a bulky stick nest. Nests are usually around 50 centimeters across when first constructed, but can grow to more than 120.</p><p>The female lays three to six, pale blue eggs. </p><p>Eggs are usually laid at two-day intervals, incubated around 27 days, and hatch asynchronously over a period of several days.</p><p>Males incubate for about 10.5 hours of each day, while females usually incubate for the remainder of each day and the night.</p><p>The first chick to hatch usually becomes more experienced in food handling and aggressive interactions with siblings, so often grows more quickly than the other chicks.</p><p>Great blue heron is a rare vagrant to coastal Spain, the Azores, and areas of far southern Europe.</p><p>An all-white population found only in south Florida and the Florida Keys is known as the great white heron.</p><p>Debate exists about whether it is a white color morph of the great blue heron, a subspecies of it, or an entirely separate species.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/ardea-herodias/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ardea-herodias/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/ardea-herodias/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ardea-herodias/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/ardea-herodias/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ardea-herodias/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T10:18:37Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Pelecaniformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Ardeidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Ardea"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Ardea herodias"}],"aliases":[],"spreading":[{"name":"Central America","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"North America","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Great blue heron calls","samplePath":"atlas/ardea-herodias/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/ardea-herodias/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ardea-herodias/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"lifespan","value":4.7335428E8,"maximum":7.25809896E8,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"15 to 23 years"},{"name":"wingspan","value":1.67,"maximum":2.01,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"1.67 to 2.01 m"},{"name":"length","value":0.91,"maximum":1.37,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"91 cm to 1.37 m"},{"name":"weight","value":1.82,"maximum":3.6,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"1.82 to 3.6 kg"},{"name":"speed.full","value":15.2778,"maximum":null,"quantity":"SPEED","nameDisplay":"Full Speed","valueDisplay":"55 km/h"},{"name":"elevation","value":0.0,"maximum":2600.0,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Elevation","valueDisplay":"Up to 2.6 km"}],"related":[{"index":40,"display":"Great white pelican","definition":"The great white pelican also known as the eastern white pelican, rosy pelican or white pelican is a bird in the pelican family.","iconPath":"atlas/pelecanus-onocrotalus/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":38,"display":"Great egret","definition":"The great egrets are white herons of the genera Ardea, characteristically having long, showy plumes during the breeding season.","iconPath":"atlas/ardea-alba/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":33,"display":"Eurasian spoonbill","definition":"The Eurasian spoonbill is a wading bird of the ibis and spoonbill family Threskiornithidae.","iconPath":"atlas/platalea-leucorodia/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":4,"display":"Australian white ibis","definition":"The Australian white ibis is a wading bird of the ibis family.
