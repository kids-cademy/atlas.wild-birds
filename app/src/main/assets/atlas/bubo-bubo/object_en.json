{"index":30,"rank":0,"name":"bubo-bubo","display":"Eurasian eagle-owl","definition":"The Eurasian eagle-owl  is a species of eagle-owl that resides in much of Eurasia.","description":"<p>It is one of the largest species of owl, and females can grow to a total length of 75 centimeters, with a wingspan of 188 centimeters, males being slightly smaller.</p><p>This bird has distinctive ear tufts, with upper parts that are mottled with darker blackish colouring and tawny.</p><p>The wings and tail are barred. The underparts are a variably hued buff, streaked with darker colour.</p><p>The facial disc is not very visible and the orange eyes are distinctive.</p><p>The Eurasian eagle-owl is one of the largest living species of owl as well as one of the most widely distributed.</p><p>The Eurasian eagle-owl is found in many habitats but is mostly a bird of mountain regions, coniferous forests, steppes and other relatively remote places.</p><p>They are often found in the largest numbers in areas where cliffs and ravines are surrounded by a scattering of trees and bushes.</p><p>Healthy adults normally have no natural predators and are thus considered apex predators.</p><p>This owl is a mostly nocturnal predator, hunting for a range of different prey species, predominantly small mammals.</p><p>It also prey on birds of varying sizes, reptiles, amphibians, fish, large insects and other assorted invertebrates.</p><p>Usually 55-80% of the food of eagle-owls is mammalian.</p><p>Anyway, the Eurasian eagle-owl is able to attack and kill large prey, far beyond the capacities of most other living owls. </p><p>Eurasian eagle-owls are strictly territorial and will defend their territories from interloping eagle-owls year around.</p><p>It typically breeds on cliff ledges, in gullies, among rocks or in other concealed locations.</p><p>The eggs are normally laid at intervals of three days and are incubated only by the female. These hatch at different times.</p><p>The female incubates the eggs and broods the young, and the male provides food for her and, when they hatch, for the nestlings as well.</p><p>Continuing parental care for the young is provided by both adults for about five months.</p><p>There are at least a dozen subspecies of Eurasian eagle-owl.</p><p>The vast majority of eagle-owls live in mainland Europe, Russia and Central Asia.</p><p>An estimated number of between 12 and 40 pairs are thought to reside in the United Kingdom as of 2016, a number which may be on the rise.</p><p>Tame eagle-owls have occasionally been used in pest control because of their size to deter large birds such as gulls from nesting.</p><p>The leading causes of death for this species are man-made: electrocution, traffic accidents and shooting frequently claim the life of eagle-owls.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/bubo-bubo/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/bubo-bubo/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/bubo-bubo/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/bubo-bubo/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/bubo-bubo/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/bubo-bubo/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T09:43:47Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Strigiformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Strigidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Bubo"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Bubo
