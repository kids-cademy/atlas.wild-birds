{"index":36,"rank":0,"name":"aquila-chrysaetos","display":"Golden eagle","definition":"A large eagle of the Northern Hemisphere, having dark plumage with brownish-yellow feathers on the back of the head and neck.","description":"<p>The golden eagle is one of the best-known birds of prey in the Northern Hemisphere.</p><p>It is the most widely distributed species of eagle. Like all eagles, it belongs to the family Accipitridae.</p><p>Adults of both sexes have similar plumage and are primarily dark brown, with some grey on the inner wing and tail.</p><p>They have a paler, typically golden colour on the back of the head that gives the species its common name.</p><p>Unlike other Aquila species, the tarsal feathers of golden eagles tend to be paler, ranging from light golden to white.</p><p>The bill is dark at the tip, fading to a lighter horn colour, with a yellow cere. </p><p>Like many accipitrids, the bare portion of the feet is yellow.</p><p>Juvenile golden eagles are similar to adults but tend to be darker, appearing black on the back. They have a less faded colour. </p><p>The diet of golden eagles is composed primarily of small mammals such as rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, prairie dogs, and marmots. </p><p>They also eat birds, reptiles and fish in smaller numbers. Golden eagles occasionally capture large prey, including seals, ungulates, coyotes and badgers. </p><p>They have also been known to capture large flying birds such as geese or cranes. </p><p>A pair of eagles will often hunt together; one chases the prey to exhaustion, and the other swoops down for the kill.</p><p>Golden eagles are monogamous, and may maintain pair bonds for several years. </p><p>In non-migrant populations, pairs appear to stay together year round. </p><p>Courtship activities in this species include undulating flight by one or both members of the pair, chases, dives, mock attacks, presenting talons, soaring together and circling. </p><p>Golden eagles are mostly silent, except during the breeding season. They use nine different calls to communicate. </p><p>Most calls appear to be associated with food delivery to nestlings and begging by the nestlings.</p><p>Golden eagles don't appear to use vocalizations to mark their territory. Instead, they use an undulating flight to defend the boundaries of their territory. </p><p>Due to its hunting prowess, the golden eagle is regarded with great mystic reverence in some ancient, tribal cultures.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/aquila-chrysaetos/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/aquila-chrysaetos/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/aquila-chrysaetos/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/aquila-chrysaetos/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/aquila-chrysaetos/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/aquila-chrysaetos/icon.jpg","caption":null},"trivia":{"path":"atlas/aquila-chrysaetos/trivia.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/aquila-chrysaetos/trivia.png","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T10:14:30Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Accipitriformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Accipitridae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Aquila"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Aquila
