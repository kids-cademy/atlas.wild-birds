They feed on or near the ground. What they eat varies with food availability during different seasons.</p><p>Budgerigars are opportunistic breeders and respond to rains when grass seeds become most abundant.</p><p>Nests are made in holes in trees, fence posts or logs lying on the ground; the four to six eggs are incubated for 18 to 21 days, with the young fledging about 30 days after hatching.</p><p>They show signs of affection to their flockmates by preening or feeding one another. </p><p>Budgerigars feed one another by eating the seeds themselves, and then regurgitating it into their flockmate's mouth.</p><p>First recorded in 1805, budgerigars are popular pets around the world due to their small size, low cost, and ability to mimic human speech.</p><p>Breeders have worked to produce a variety of colour, pattern and feather mutations, including albino, blue, cinnamon-ino, clearwinged, crested, dark, greywinged, opaline, pieds, spangled, dilute and violet. </p><p>They are the third most popular pet in the world, after the domesticated dog and cat.</p><p>Budgerigars are social animals and require stimulation in the shape of toys and interaction with humans or with other budgerigars. </p><p>The budgerigar is closely related to lories and the fig parrots.</p><p>The main predators of the wild budgerigar are snakes and birds of prey such as hawks.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/melopsittacus-undulatus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/melopsittacus-undulatus/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/melopsittacus-undulatus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/melopsittacus-undulatus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/melopsittacus-undulatus/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/melopsittacus-undulatus/featured.png","caption":"<p>Researchers has found that budgerigar flies at just two speed levels. </p><p>They noted that slow mode is approximately half the speed of fast mode.
