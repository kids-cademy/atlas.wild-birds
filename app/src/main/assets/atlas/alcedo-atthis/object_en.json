{"index":18,"rank":0,"name":"alcedo-atthis","display":"Common kingfisher","definition":"The common kingfisher is a small kingfisher with seven subspecies recognized within its wide distribution across Eurasia and North Africa.","description":"<p>Common kingfisher is resident in much of its range, but migrates from areas where rivers freeze in winter.</p><p>This sparrow-sized bird has the typical short-tailed, large-headed kingfisher profile; it has blue upperparts, orange underparts and a long bill.</p><p>It feeds mainly on fish, caught by diving, and has special visual adaptations to enable it to see prey under water.</p><p>The glossy white eggs are laid in a nest at the end of a burrow in a riverbank.</p><p>This species has the typical short-tailed, dumpy-bodied large-headed and long-billed kingfisher shape.</p><p>It has a green-blue neck stripe, white neck blaze and throat, rufous underparts, and a black bill with some red at the base.</p><p>The legs and feet are bright red.</p><p>The female is identical in appearance to the male except that her lower mandible is orange-red with a black tip.</p><p>The juvenile is similar to the adult, but with duller and greener upperparts and paler underparts. Its bill is black, and the legs are also initially black.</p><p>The common kingfisher hunts from a perch above the water, on a branch, post or riverbank, bill pointing down as it searches for prey. </p><p>It bobs its head when food is detected to gauge the distance, and plunges steeply down to seize its prey usually no deeper than 25 cm below the surface.</p><p>The wings are opened under water and the open eyes are protected by the transparent third eyelid. </p><p>The bird rises beak-first from the surface and flies back to its perch.</p><p>Like all kingfishers, the common kingfisher is highly territorial.</p><p>Since it must eat around 60% of its body weight each day, it is essential to have control of a suitable stretch of river. </p><p>The courtship is initiated by the male chasing the female while calling continually, and later by ritual feeding, with copulation usually following.</p><p>The nest is in a burrow excavated by both birds of the pair in a low vertical riverbank, or sometimes a quarry or other cutting. </p><p>The common kingfisher typically lays two to ten glossy white eggs, which average 1.9 centimeters. </p><p>Both sexes incubate by day, but only the female at night. </p><p>The common kingfisher has no song. The flight call is a short sharp whistle, chee, repeated two or three times.</p><p>Anxious birds emit a harsh, shrit-it-it and nestlings call for food with a churring noise.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/alcedo-atthis/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/alcedo-atthis/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/alcedo-atthis/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/alcedo-atthis/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/alcedo-atthis/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/alcedo-atthis/featured.png","caption":"<p>Kingfisher hunts from a perch above the water, bill pointing down as it searches for prey. </p><p>It bobs its head when food is detected and plunges steeply down to seize its prey.</p>"},"icon":{"path":"atlas/alcedo-atthis/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/alcedo-atthis/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T07:36:43Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Coraciiformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Alcedinidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Alcedo"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Alcedo atthis"}],"aliases":["Eurasian kingfisher","River kingfisher"],"spreading":[{"name":"Eurasia","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Africa","area":"NORTH","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Common kingfisher calls","samplePath":"atlas/alcedo-atthis/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/alcedo-atthis/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/alcedo-atthis/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"lifespan","value":2.20898664E8,"maximum":6.62695992E8,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"7 to 21 years"},{"name":"length","value":0.16,"maximum":0.17,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"16 to 17 cm"},{"name":"wingspan","value":0.24,"maximum":0.26,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"24 to 26 cm"},{"name":"weight","value":0.035,"maximum":0.04,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"35 to 40 grams"},{"name":"speed.full","value":11.1111,"maximum":null,"quantity":"SPEED","nameDisplay":"Full Speed","valueDisplay":"40 km/h"},{"name":"depth","value":0.0,"maximum":0.25,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Diving Depth","valueDisplay":"Up to 25 cm"}],"related":[{"index":4,"display":"Australian white ibis","definition":"The Australian white ibis is a wading bird of the ibis family.
