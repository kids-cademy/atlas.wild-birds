{"index":51,"rank":0,"name":"antigone-canadensis","display":"Sandhill crane","definition":"The sandhill crane  is a species of large crane of North America and extreme northeastern Siberia.","description":"<p>Sandhill cranes  adults are gray overall; during breeding, their plumage is usually much worn and stained, particularly in the migratory populations, and looks nearly ochre. </p><p>They have red foreheads, white cheeks, and long, dark, pointed bills. </p><p>The sexes look alike. Immature birds have reddish-brown upperparts and gray underparts.</p><p>In flight, their long, dark legs trail behind, and their long necks keep straight. </p><p>Sizes vary among the different subspecies; the average height of these birds is around 80 to 136 centimeters.</p><p>Sandhill cranes breed in open wetland habitats surrounded by shrubs or trees. </p><p>They nest in marshes, bogs, wet meadows, prairies, burned-over aspen stands, and other moist habitats, preferring those with standing water. </p><p>Breeders gravitate toward the edges between wetland and upland habitats, while nonbreeders may prefer open, grassy sites. </p><p>On winter they roost on shallow lakes or rivers at night and spending the day in irrigated croplands, pastures, grasslands, or wetlands.</p><p>The omnivorous Sandhill crane feeds on land or in shallow marshes where plants grow out of the water, gleaning from the surface and probing with its bill. </p><p>Its diet is heavy in seeds and cultivated grains, but may also include berries, tubers, small vertebrates, and invertebrates. </p><p>Nonmigratory populations eat adult and larval insects, snails, reptiles, amphibians, nestling birds, small mammals, seeds, and berries.</p><p>Sandhill cranes raise one brood per year. </p><p>Both members of a breeding pair build the nest using plant material from the surrounding area. </p><p>Nest sites are usually marshes, bogs, or swales, though occasionally on dry land. </p><p>Females lay one to three oval, dull brown eggs with reddish markings. Both parents incubate the eggs for about 30 days. </p><p>The chicks are precocial; they hatch covered in down, with their eyes open, and able to leave the nest within a day. </p><p>The parents brood the chicks for up to three weeks after hatching, feeding them intensively for the first few weeks, then gradually less frequently.</p><p>The chicks remain with their parents until one to two months before the parents lay the next clutch of eggs the following year. </p><p>After leaving their parents, the chicks form nomadic flocks with other juveniles and nonbreeders. </p><p>They remain in these flocks until they form breeding pairs at between two and seven years old. </p><p>These cranes frequently give a loud, trumpeting call that suggests a rolled \"r\" in the throat, and they can be heard from a long distance. </p><p>As a conspicuous ground-dwelling species, sandhill cranes are at risk from predators. </p><p>When an avian predator approaches, the sandhill crane flies at it, kicking it with its feet. </p><p>When the predator is a mammal, it will move towards it, with its wings spread, and points its bill at it. </p><p>If it is not scared off, the crane then attacks, hissing, stabbing with its bill and kicking with its feet. </p><p>Mammals such as foxes, raccoons, and coyotes hunt large numbers of young cranes. </p><p>Wolves, cougars, bobcats, and lynx ambush this cranes  by taking them by surprise. </p><p>Corvids, such as ravens and crows, gulls, and smaller raptors such as hawks feed on young cranes and eggs.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/antigone-canadensis/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/antigone-canadensis/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/antigone-canadensis/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/antigone-canadensis/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/antigone-canadensis/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/antigone-canadensis/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-24T14:29:21Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Gruiformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Gruidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Antigone"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Antigone canadensis"}],"aliases":[],"spreading":[{"name":"North America","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Siberia","area":"NORTH_EAST","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":{"value":10.0,"mask":132102},"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Sandhill crane calls","samplePath":"atlas/antigone-canadensis/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/antigone-canadensis/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/antigone-canadensis/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"lifespan","value":6.3113904E8,"maximum":null,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"20 years"},{"name":"wingspan","value":1.6,"maximum":2.3,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"1.6 to 2.3 m"},{"name":"length","value":0.8,"maximum":136.0,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"80 cm to 136 m"},{"name":"weight","value":2.7,"maximum":6.7,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"2.7 to 6.7 kg"},{"name":"length.tail","value":0.1,"maximum":0.264,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Tail Length","valueDisplay":"10 to 26.4 cm"},{"name":"speed","value":11.1111,"maximum":14.4444,"quantity":"SPEED","nameDisplay":"Speed","valueDisplay":"40 to 52 km/h"}],"related":[{"index":41,"display":"Greater flamingo","definition":"The greater flamingo is the most widespread and largest species of the flamingo family.","iconPath":"atlas/phoenicopterus-roseus/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":37,"display":"Great blue heron","definition":"The great blue heron is a large wading bird in the heron family Ardeidae, common near the shores of open water and in weatlands.","iconPath":"atlas/ardea-herodias/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":55,"display":"White stork","definition":"The white stork is a large bird in the stork family Ciconiidae.
