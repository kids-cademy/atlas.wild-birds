{"index":32,"rank":0,"name":"pica-pica","display":"Eurasian magpie","definition":"The Eurasian magpie is a resident breeding bird throughout the northern part of the Eurasian continent.","description":"<p>In Europe, 'magpie' is used by English speakers as a synonym for the European magpie.</p><p>The head, neck and breast are glossy black with a metallic green and violet sheen; the belly and scapulars (shoulder feathers) are pure white. </p><p>The wings are black glossed with green or purple, and the primaries have white inner webs, conspicuous when the wing is open. </p><p>The graduated tail is black, glossed with green and reddish purple. The legs and bill are black; the iris is dark brown. </p><p>The plumage of the sexes is similar but females are slightly smaller. </p><p>The young resemble the adults, but are at first without much of the gloss on the sooty plumage. </p><p>Some magpies breed after their first year, while others remain in the non-breeding flocks and first breed in their second year.</p><p>They are monogamous, and the pairs often remain together from one breeding season to the next. </p><p>They generally occupy the same territory on successive years.</p><p>The Eurasian magpie is one of the most intelligent birds, and it is believed to be one of the most intelligent of all non-human animals.</p><p>The  relative size of its brain is more close to the brain size of chimpanzees, orangutans and humans that to its relatives birds.</p><p>It is the only bird known to pass the mirror test, apart from very few other non-avian species.</p><p>Eurasian magpies have a well-known call. It is a choking chatter 'chac-chac' or a repetitive 'chac-chac-chac-chac'. </p><p>The young also emit the previous call, although they also emit an acute call similar to a 'Uik Uik', which may resemble the barking of a small dog. </p><p>Both adults and young can emit a kind of hiss barely noticeable from afar.</p><p>Adults undergo an annual complete moult after breeding.  Moult begins in June or July and ends in September or October. </p><p>The subspecies differ in their size, the amount of white on their plumage and the colour of the gloss on their black feathers. </p><p>The Asian subspecies P. p. bactriana has more extensive white on the primaries and a prominent white rump.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/pica-pica/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/pica-pica/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/pica-pica/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/pica-pica/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/pica-pica/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/pica-pica/featured.png","caption":"<p>Eurasian magpie is the only bird known to pass the mirror test.</p><p>The mirror test is the traditional method for attempting to measure self-awareness.</p>"},"icon":{"path":"atlas/pica-pica/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/pica-pica/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-25T03:00:21Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Passeriformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Corvidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Pica"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Pica pica"}],"aliases":["Common magpie"],"spreading":[{"name":"Eurasia","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Eurasian magpie calls","samplePath":"atlas/pica-pica/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/pica-pica/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/pica-pica/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"lifespan","value":1.167607224E8,"maximum":null,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"3.7 years"},{"name":"lifespan.record","value":6.847858584E8,"maximum":null,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan Record","valueDisplay":"21.7 years"},{"name":"length","value":0.44,"maximum":0.46,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"44 to 46 cm"},{"name":"wingspan","value":0.52,"maximum":0.62,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"52 to 62 cm"},{"name":"weight","value":0.2,"maximum":0.25,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"200 to 250 grams"},{"name":"speed.full","value":8.8889,"maximum":null,"quantity":"SPEED","nameDisplay":"Full Speed","valueDisplay":"32 km/h"},{"name":"length.tail","value":0.12,"maximum":0.28,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Tail Length","valueDisplay":"12 to 28 cm"}],"related":[{"index":25,"display":"Common raven","definition":"The common raven is a large all-black passerine bird.
