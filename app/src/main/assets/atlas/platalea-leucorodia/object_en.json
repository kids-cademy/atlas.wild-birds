although these are possibly ingested accidentally with animal matter.</p><p>The breeding season varies according to the range, depending on water levels in some parts of the distribution.</p><p>The Eurasian Spoonbill nests in monospecific colonies. </p><p>Both sexes take part in building the platform, but mainly the female with materials brought by the male. </p><p>The nest is made with sticks, twigs, reeds or grass stems, and lined with grass and leaves. </p><p>It is placed on the ground on islands, or in trees or bushes, about 5 metres above the ground.</p><p>The Eurasian Spoonbill performs powerful flight with extended neck and legs. </p><p>It performs short glides interspersed with fast, shallow wing-beats.</p><p>They are mostly silent. </p><p>Even at their breeding colonies the main sounds are bill snapping, occasional deep grunting and occasional trumpeting noises.</p><p>Threats to the Eurasian spoonbill include habitat destruction by drainage and degradation by pollution.</p><p>It is especially adversely affected by the disappearance of reed swamps.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/platalea-leucorodia/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/platalea-leucorodia/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/platalea-leucorodia/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/platalea-leucorodia/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/platalea-leucorodia/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/platalea-leucorodia/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T09:55:34Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Pelecaniformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Threskiornithidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Platalea"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Platalea leucorodia"}],"aliases":["White spoonbill","Spoonbill"],"spreading":[],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":null,"samplePath":null,"waveformPath":null,"waveformSrc":null,"facts":[],"features":[{"name":"lifespan","value":7.889238E8,"maximum":9.4670856E8,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"25 to 30 years"},{"name":"length","value":0.7,"maximum":0.95,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"70 to 95 cm"},{"name":"wingspan","value":1.15,"maximum":1.35,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"1.15 to 1.35 m"},{"name":"height","value":0.8,"maximum":0.9,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Height","valueDisplay":"80 to 90 cm"},{"name":"weight","value":1.13,"maximum":1.96,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"1.13 to 1.96 kg"}],"related":[{"index":37,"display":"Great blue heron","definition":"The great blue heron is a large wading bird in the heron family Ardeidae, common near the shores of open water and in weatlands.","iconPath":"atlas/ardea-herodias/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":40,"display":"Great white pelican","definition":"The great white pelican also known as the eastern white pelican, rosy pelican or white pelican is a bird in the pelican family.","iconPath":"atlas/pelecanus-onocrotalus/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":38,"display":"Great egret","definition":"The great egrets are white herons of the genera Ardea, characteristically having long, showy plumes during the breeding season.","iconPath":"atlas/ardea-alba/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":4,"display":"Australian white ibis","definition":"The Australian white ibis is a wading bird of the ibis family.
