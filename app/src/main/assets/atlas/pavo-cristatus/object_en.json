{"index":43,"rank":0,"name":"pavo-cristatus","display":"Indian peafowl","definition":"The Indian peafowl is a large and brightly coloured bird, is a species of peafowl native to the Indian subcontinent, but introduced in many other parts of the world.","description":"<p>Indian peafowl are among the largest and heaviest representatives of the pheasant family. </p><p>So far as is known, only the wild turkey grows notably heavier.</p><p>Their size, colour and shape of crest make them unmistakable within their native distribution range. </p><p>The male is metallic blue on the crown, the feathers of the head being short and curled. </p><p>The back has scaly bronze-green feathers with black and copper markings. </p><p>The scapular and the wings are buff and barred in black, the primaries are chestnut and the secondaries are black. </p><p>The tail is dark brown and the \"train\" is made up of elongated upper tail coverts and nearly all of these feathers end with an elaborate eye-spot.</p><p>It is found in moist and dry-deciduous forests, but can adapt to live in cultivated regions and around human habitations and is usually found where water is available.</p><p>They can also be found in bushlands and rainforests. Many will nest on the ground while some will roost in trees.</p><p>Peafowl are omnivorous and eat seeds, insects, fruits, small mammals and reptiles. </p><p>They feed on small snakes but keep their distance from larger ones.</p><p>In the Gir forest of Gujarat, a large percentage of their food is made up of the fallen berries of Zizyphus.</p><p>Around cultivated areas, peafowl feed on a wide range of crops such as groundnut, tomato, paddy, chili and even bananas.</p><p>In the countryside, it is particularly partial to crops and garden plants. </p><p>Peacocks are polygamous, and the breeding season is spread out but appears to be dependent on the rains.</p><p>The nest is a shallow scrape in the ground lined with leaves, sticks and other debris. </p><p>Nests are sometimes placed on buildings.</p><p>The clutch consists of 4 to 8 fawn to buff white eggs which are incubated only by the female. </p><p>The eggs take about 28 days to hatch. </p><p>The chicks are nidifugous and follow the mother around after hatching.</p><p>Downy young may sometimes climb on their mothers' back and the female may carry them in flight to a safe tree branch.</p><p>Peafowl are best known for the male's extravagant display feathers which, despite actually growing from their back, are thought of as a tail. </p><p>Peafowl forage on the ground in small groups, known as musters, that usually have a cock and 3 to 5 hens.</p><p>When disturbed, they usually escape by running and rarely take to flight.</p><p>Anyway, adult peafowl can escape ground predators by flying into trees. </p><p>Large mammals such as leopards, dholes, wolves, lions and tigers can sometimes ambush them.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/pavo-cristatus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/pavo-cristatus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/pavo-cristatus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/pavo-cristatus/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/pavo-cristatus/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/pavo-cristatus/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-25T04:46:52Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Galliformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Phasianidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Pavo"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Pavo cristatus"}],"aliases":["Common peafowl","Blue peafowl","Peacock"],"spreading":[{"name":"Indian subcontinent","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Indian peafowl call","samplePath":"atlas/pavo-cristatus/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/pavo-cristatus/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/pavo-cristatus/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"lifespan","value":4.7335428E8,"maximum":null,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"15 years"},{"name":"lifespan.captivity","value":7.25809896E8,"maximum":null,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan in Captivity","valueDisplay":"23 years"},{"name":"elevation","value":0.0,"maximum":2000.0,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Elevation","valueDisplay":"Up to 2 km"},{"name":"length","value":0.95,"maximum":1.15,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"95 cm to 1.15 m"},{"name":"weight","value":2.75,"maximum":6.0,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"2.75 to 6 kg"},{"name":"wingspan","value":1.4,"maximum":1.6,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"1.4 to 1.6 m"}],"related":[{"index":23,"display":"Common pheasant","definition":"The common pheasant is a bird in the pheasant family.
