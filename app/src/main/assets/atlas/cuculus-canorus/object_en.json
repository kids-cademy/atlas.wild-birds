{"index":15,"rank":0,"name":"cuculus-canorus","display":"Common cuckoo","definition":"A grayish bird of Eurasia and Africa that has a characteristic two-note call and lays its eggs in the nests of birds of other species.","description":"<p>Essentially a bird of open land, the common cuckoo is a widespread summer migrant to Europe and Asia, and winters in Africa. </p><p>Birds arrive in Europe in April and leave in September.</p><p>The common cuckoo is 32 to 34 centimetres long from bill to tail - with a tail of 13 to 15 centimetres, and a wingspan of 55 to 60 centimetres.</p><p>Males weigh around 130 grams and females 110 grams. </p><p>The legs are short. It has a greyish, slender body and long tail, similar to a sparrowhawk in flight, where the wingbeats are regular. </p><p>All adult males are slate-grey; the grey throat extends well down the bird's breast with a sharp demarcation to the barred underparts.</p><p>The iris, orbital ring, the base of the bill and feet are yellow.</p><p>The most obvious identification features of juvenile common cuckoos are the white nape patch and white feather fringes.</p><p>Common cuckoos is a versatile bird and can live almost anywhere.</p><p>They frequents coniferous and deciduous forests and woodlands, open wooded areas, forest edges and clearings, steppes with trees, meadows, marshes and reedbeds, cultivated areas with trees and bushes.</p><p>This cuckoo is an insectivore, eating mainly insects and their larvae. </p><p>It also occasionally eats eggs and chicks.</p><p>It can eat hairy caterpillars, which are distasteful to many birds, being a specialty of preference. </p><p>During the breeding season, common cuckoos often settle on an open perch with drooped wings and raised tail.</p><p>The male's song, goo-ko, is usually given from an open perch. The female has a loud bubbling call.</p><p>It is a brood parasite, which means it lays eggs in the nests of other bird species, particularly of dunnocks, meadow pipits, and reed warblers.</p><p>Although its eggs are larger than those of its hosts, the eggs in each type of host nest resemble the host's eggs.</p><p>When the host species leaves the nest unattended, the female cuckoo removes one of the host's eggs from the nest, then lays her own before the host returns.</p><p>Common cuckoos moult twice a year: a partial moult in summer and a complete moult in winter.</p><p>The common cuckoo is a member of the cuckoo order of birds which includes the roadrunners, the anis and the coucals.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/cuculus-canorus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/cuculus-canorus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/cuculus-canorus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/cuculus-canorus/cover.png","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/cuculus-canorus/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/cuculus-canorus/featured.png","caption":"<p>The cuckoo is not poisoned after eating the toxic caterpillar. </p><p>Before eating it, the cuckoo will bite one end of the caterpillar, slice the caterpillar using its beak, then shake the insect at one end until the toxic contents are released.</p>"},"icon":{"path":"atlas/cuculus-canorus/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/cuculus-canorus/icon.jpg","caption":null},"trivia":{"path":"atlas/cuculus-canorus/trivia.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/cuculus-canorus/trivia.png","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T07:15:32Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Cuculiformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Cuculidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Cuculus"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Cuculus canorus"}],"aliases":[],"spreading":[{"name":"Africa","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Eurasia","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Common cuckoo calls.","samplePath":"atlas/cuculus-canorus/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/cuculus-canorus/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/cuculus-canorus/waveform.png","facts":[{"name":"20% of eggs are recognized as foreign","value":"20% of cuckoo's eggs will be recognized as foreign eggs and eliminated from the nest."},{"name":"Does not build its own nests","value":"Cuckoo does not build its own nests, because it is a brood parasite.
