The female lays eggs on a daily basis over a period of several days. </p><p>There are normally four or five eggs that are ovoid in shape and pale blue .</p><p>Incubation lasts thirteen days, although the last egg laid may take 24 hours longer than the first to hatch. </p><p>Both parents share the responsibility of brooding the eggs, but the female spends more time incubating them than does the male, and is the only parent to do so at night when the male returns to the communal roost. </p><p>The young are born blind and naked. </p><p>They develop light fluffy down within seven days of hatching and can see within nine days.</p><p>A majority of starling predators are avian. </p><p>The typical response of starling groups is to take flight, with a common sight being undulating flocks of starling flying high in quick and agile patterns. </p><p>Their abilities in flight are seldom matched by birds of prey.</p><p>Adult common starlings are hunted by hawks such as the northern goshawk and Eurasian sparrowhawk, and falcons including the peregrine falcon, Eurasian hobby and common kestrel.</p><p>Slower raptors like black and red kites, eastern imperial eagle, common buzzard and Australasian harrier tend to take the more easily caught fledglings or juveniles.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/sturnus-vulgaris/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/sturnus-vulgaris/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/sturnus-vulgaris/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/sturnus-vulgaris/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/sturnus-vulgaris/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/sturnus-vulgaris/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-26T08:27:21Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Passeriformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Sturnidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Sturnus"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Sturnus vulgaris"}],"aliases":["European starling"],"spreading":[{"name":"Europe","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Asia","area":"WEST","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"North America","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Common starling song","samplePath":"atlas/sturnus-vulgaris/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/sturnus-vulgaris/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/sturnus-vulgaris/waveform.png","facts":[{"name":"Young birds can fly at 18 days","value":"Young birds can fly at the age of 18 to 21 days, but they are not ready for the independent life at least one or two weeks."},{"name":"European starling is an omnivore","value":"European starling is an omnivore (it eats plants and meat).
