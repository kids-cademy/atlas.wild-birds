The vast majority of their diet consists of insects, and they primarily hunt flying insects. </p><p>Some of their common prey items include flies, aphids, flying ants, and more.</p><p>They catch these flying insects right out of the air. </p><p>In watery areas they fly lower to the ground, and in other areas they hunt between 18 and 48 meters above the ground.</p><p>Pairs of martins work together to build a closed cup nest from mud pellets under eaves or similar locations on buildings usually in colonies.</p><p>Females lay an average of four or five eggs, and they usually take all incubation duties. </p><p>It takes about two weeks for the eggs to hatch, and three or four weeks for the chicks to begin learning to fly. </p><p>After they leave the nest, the parents feed the chicks for about a week before the chicks become self-sufficient.</p><p>The common house martin wings beat is around 5.3 beats per second, which is faster than its relative, the barn swallow.</p><p>The flight speed of 40 kilometers per hour is typical for its family.</p><p>The common house martin is a noisy species, especially at its breeding colonies.</p><p>The male's song, given throughout the year, is a soft twitter of melodious chirps.</p><p>The contact call, also given on the wintering grounds, is a hard chirrrp, and the alarm is a shrill tseep.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/delichon-urbicum/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/delichon-urbicum/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/delichon-urbicum/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/delichon-urbicum/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/delichon-urbicum/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/delichon-urbicum/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-25T03:13:56Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Passeriformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Hirundinidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Delichon"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Delichon
