{"index":13,"rank":0,"name":"corvus-corone","display":"Carrion crow","definition":"The carrion crow  is a passerine bird of the family Corvidae and the genus Corvus which is native to western Europe and eastern Asia.","description":"<p>The plumage of the carrion crow is black with a green or purple sheen, much greener than the gloss of the rook.</p><p>The bill, legs and feet are also black.</p><p>The beak of the carrion crow is stouter and in consequence looks shorter, and nostrils are covered at all ages with bristle-like feathers.</p><p>As well as this, the wings of a carrion crow are proportionally shorter and broader than those of the rook when seen in flight.</p><p>The carrion crow has a wingspan of 84 to 100 centimeters and weighs 370 to 650 grams.</p><p>There is frequent confusion between the carrion crow and the rook, another black corvid found within its range.</p><p>It can be distinguished from the common raven by its size 48 to 52 centimeters in length as compared to an average of 63 centimeters for ravens, and from the hooded crow by its black plumage.</p><p>Carrion crows have a broad diet, including carcasses, eggs, insects, small vertebrates, molluscs, and even vegetables and grains in winter.</p><p>They bury food for later consumption, and occasionally drop certain food items with hard shells, such as crabs and nuts, from a height in order to obtain the food inside.</p><p>This crow starts to breed at three years of age.  Pairs, once formed, last for life. </p><p>Courtship involves mutual preening, and a rapid head-bowing display by the male. </p><p>Breeding pairs are very territorial, and create solitary nests in trees, bushes or on cliffs.</p><p>The nest consists of thick branches and twigs intertwined with pegs, rags, paper, bones and other odd objects, held together with mud and dung and lined with wool, hair and grass. </p><p>The 3 to 4 brown-speckled blue or greenish eggs are incubated for 18 to 20 days by the female alone, who is fed by the male. </p><p>The young fledge after 29 to 30 days.</p><p>In the early part of their life, chicks are fed on regurgitated food by the female. </p><p>Both parents then provision them with worms and maggots, progressing to various types of meat at a later stage.</p><p>It is not uncommon for an offspring from the previous years to stay around and help rear the new hatchlings. </p><p>Instead of seeking out a mate, it looks for food and assists the parents in feeding the young.</p><p>Carrion crows work collectively to provide protection from predators and other intruders.</p><p>They do exhibit a specific behaviour of resting upon some prominent perch vocalising quite loudly with a series of harsh, timed croaks.</p><p>Carrion crow vocalisations are croaky and harsh, and somewhat harder than those of the hooded crow;  the name 'crow' is imitative of their calls.</p><p>Carrion crow are known to have a strange interest with fire, and have been seen carrying burning material to the nest, and then displaying unusual behaviour.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/corvus-corone/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/corvus-corone/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/corvus-corone/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/corvus-corone/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/corvus-corone/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/corvus-corone/featured.png","caption":"<p>Crow is smaller than raven.
