{"index":54,"rank":0,"name":"diomedea-exulans","display":"Wandering albatross","definition":"A large, mostly white albatross of southern seas, having long narrow wings whose spread is regarded as the largest of any living bird.","description":"<p>Wandering albatross is one of the largest birds in the world and has the greatest known wingspan of any living bird.</p><p>It is also one of the most far ranging birds.</p><p>Some individual wandering albatrosses are known to circumnavigate the Southern Ocean three times, covering more than 120,000 km in one year.</p><p>The plumage varies with age, with the juveniles starting chocolate brown. </p><p>As they age they become whiter. The adults have white bodies with black and white wings. </p><p>Males have whiter wings than females with just the tips and trailing edges of the wings black.</p><p>Wandering albatrosses inhabit subantarctic islands with tussock grass, sedges, shrubs, mosses and peat soils. </p><p>They nest on ridges, plateaus, valleys, and plains.</p><p>Wandering albatrosses travel vast distances and tend to feed further out in open oceans than other albatrosses.</p><p>They also tend to forage in colder waters further south than other albatrosses. </p><p>They feed on cephalopods, small fish, and crustaceans and on animal refuse that floats on the sea, eating to such excess at times that they are unable to fly and rest helplessly on the water. </p><p>They are prone to following ships for refuse. They can also make shallow dives. </p><p>The wandering albatross breeds every other year.</p><p>At breeding time they occupy loose colonies on isolated island groups in the Southern Ocean. </p><p>They lay one egg that is white, with a few spots, and is about 10 centimeters long. </p><p>The nests are a large bowl built of grassy vegetation and soil peat, that is one meter wide at the base and half a meter wide at the apex. </p><p>Incubation takes about 11 weeks and both parents are involved.</p><p>They are a monogamous species, usually for life. </p><p>Adolescents return to the colony within six years; however they will not start breeding until 11 to 15 years.</p><p>Wanderers have a large range of displays from screams and whistles to grunts and bill clapping.</p><p>When courting they will spread their wings, wave their heads, and rap their bills together, while braying.</p><p>Adult wandering albatrosses have no predators. </p><p>Eggs, hatchlings, and juveniles, on the other hand, are preyed upon by sheathbills and skuas. </p><p>In addition to these two, several introduced animals like goats, pigs, rats, mice, and cats also eat the chicks and eggs.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/diomedea-exulans/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/diomedea-exulans/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/diomedea-exulans/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/diomedea-exulans/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/diomedea-exulans/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/diomedea-exulans/featured.png","caption":"<p>Sometimes,
