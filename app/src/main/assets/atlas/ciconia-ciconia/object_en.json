{"index":55,"rank":0,"name":"ciconia-ciconia","display":"White stork","definition":"The white stork is a large bird in the stork family Ciconiidae. It is well known for delivering human babies.","description":"<p>The white stork is a long-distance migrant, wintering in Africa from tropical Sub-Saharan Africa to as far south as South Africa, or on the Indian subcontinent.</p><p>White stork plumage is mainly white, with black on its wings.</p><p>The white stork is a large bird. When standing up, its height is 100 to 125 centimeters. </p><p>Adults have long red legs and long pointed red beaks, and measure on average 100 to 115 centimeters from beak tip to end of tail.</p><p>As with other storks, the wings are long and broad enabling the bird to soar.</p><p>The sexes are identical in appearance, except that males are larger than females on average.</p><p>The white stork’s preferred habitats are riverbanks, marshes, swamps, ditches, grasslands and meadows. </p><p>They tend to avoid areas that are overgrown with tall trees and shrubs.</p><p>The white stork is completely diurnal - active during the day. </p><p>Its preferred feeding grounds are shallow wetlands, grassy meadows and farmland. </p><p>The white stork is a carnivore and feeds up on a variety of animal from both the ground, among low vegetation, and from shallow water. </p><p>Prey includes amphibians, reptiles such as lizards, snakes and frogs, insects, fish, small birds and small mammals.</p><p>White stork is a monogamous breeder, but does not pair for life.</p><p>Both members of the pair build a large stick nest, which may be used for several years.</p><p>Each year the female can lay one clutch of usually four eggs, which hatch asynchronously 33 to 34 days after being laid.</p><p>Both parents take turns incubating the eggs and both feed the young.</p><p>Upon hatching, the young white stork is partly covered with short, sparse, whitish down feathers.</p><p>The young leave the nest 58 to 64 days after hatching, and continue to be fed by the parents for a further 7 to 20 days.</p><p>The white stork is a gregarious bird; flocks of thousands of individuals have been recorded on migration routes and at wintering areas in Africa.</p><p>When migrating between Europe and Africa, the white stork avoids crossing the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p>It detours via the Levant in the east or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west, because the air thermals on which it depends for soaring do not form over water.</p><p>Whereas adult white storks have to fear few natural enemies, juveniles might be preyed on by big raptors. </p><p>However,  man-made factors like electrocution, poaching and habitat loss pose by far greater threats.</p><p>This conspicuous species has given rise to many legends across its range, of which the best-known is the story of babies being brought by storks.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/ciconia-ciconia/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ciconia-ciconia/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/ciconia-ciconia/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ciconia-ciconia/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/ciconia-ciconia/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ciconia-ciconia/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-01-25T16:56:45Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Aves"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Ciconiiformes"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Ciconiidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Ciconia"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Ciconia ciconia"}],"aliases":[],"spreading":[{"name":"Eurasia","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"},{"name":"Africa","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"White stork display","samplePath":"atlas/ciconia-ciconia/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/ciconia-ciconia/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/wild-birds/ciconia-ciconia/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"lifespan","value":6.3113904E8,"maximum":1.10449332E9,"quantity":"TIME","nameDisplay":"Lifespan","valueDisplay":"20 to 35 years"},{"name":"length","value":1.0,"maximum":1.15,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Body Length","valueDisplay":"1 to 1.15 m"},{"name":"wingspan","value":1.55,"maximum":2.15,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Wingspan","valueDisplay":"1.55 to 2.15 m"},{"name":"weight","value":2.3,"maximum":4.5,"quantity":"MASS","nameDisplay":"Weight","valueDisplay":"2.3 to 4.5 kg"},{"name":"height","value":1.0,"maximum":1.25,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Height","valueDisplay":"1 to 1.25 m"},{"name":"elevation","value":0.0,"maximum":3500.0,"quantity":"LENGTH","nameDisplay":"Elevation","valueDisplay":"Up to 3.5 km"}],"related":[{"index":51,"display":"Sandhill crane","definition":"The sandhill crane  is a species of large crane of North America and extreme northeastern Siberia.","iconPath":"atlas/antigone-canadensis/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":41,"display":"Greater flamingo","definition":"The greater flamingo is the most widespread and largest species of the flamingo family.","iconPath":"atlas/phoenicopterus-roseus/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":38,"display":"Great egret","definition":"The great egrets are white herons of the genera Ardea, characteristically having long, showy plumes during the breeding season.","iconPath":"atlas/ardea-alba/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":33,"display":"Eurasian spoonbill","definition":"The Eurasian spoonbill is a wading bird of the ibis and spoonbill family Threskiornithidae.","iconPath":"atlas/platalea-leucorodia/icon.jpg","iconSrc":null},{"index":4,"display":"Australian white ibis","definition":"The Australian white ibis is a wading bird of the ibis family.
